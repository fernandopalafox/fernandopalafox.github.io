Here's something that's been on my mind lately: I hate this idea that I'm just being a vulnerable boy for no reason. 
That I have to justify what I'm doing for someone. 
I've had this feeling that I have to justify doing all this writing.
That I should be ashamed or scared that I'm so vulnerable in all the writing I do. 
But I keep thinking 

Trying to hide what you're really feeling is not possible. 
Because, whether we like it or not, who we are is very obvious to most people around us, so we might as well lean into it. 
Our soft gooey interior leaks out in the way we speak, our mannerisms, our expressions, and our actions. 
You may be able to keep it from people earlier in their spiritual development and understanding, or people who simply don't care. 
But it will be immediately apparent to anyone you care to bring close to you.
So you might as well embrace it.

And somehow, trying to hide all this stuff all thi stuff just makes it a bigger deal than it is. 
Avoiding the feelings only makes them more important.

Being vulnerable and honest about who we are is also a superpower.
There's a certain security and attractiveness that one just exudes when they stop trying to contort themselves about what's more acceptable. 
One reason for this could be that this may be a proxy for competence: having clear comprehension of your capabilities means you can take care of yourself. 
And perhaps even, being to take care of a community.
It requires a signficant level of emotional stability, and that's attractive.

I have some personal experience in this arena. 
Once I stopped caring about what people thought of me, and just started focusing on what I found interesting I found that people just magically showed up. 
First of all, no one thinks about you as much as you might like to think, 
And second of all, why does it even matter? 
Are they living your life? 
Are they feeling your feelings? 
Will they fix your problems? 
No. 
It's only you. 

Another reason why honesty may be useful is because it automatically relaxes you. 
As you stop trying to make things other than what they are, we release a bunch of built up tension.
And it's way more pleasant to be next to someone who isn't constantly tugging at their existence.

In any case, vulnerable writing seems to be the only real writing we have in us.
Nietszsche said "Of all  that is written, I love ony what a man write in his own blood. Write in blood and you will realize that blood is spirit.

Innovation seems to come about at the intersection of the particular set of unique circumstances that have shaped you into who you are. 

Writing that pads a the boundaries of the human conditions only happens 

Quote Nietszche

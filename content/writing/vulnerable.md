Here's something that's been on my mind lately: vulnerable writing.
Before you roll your eyes I'll just say what I think about it: **if you're writing to express yourself, vulnerable writing is the only kind you have. And letting it out might be a great idea**.
This hit me while wrestling over whether to share my writing.
My life was changed this year, and I felt a pull to share all the beautiful things I'd discovered about life, emotions, and meaning. 
But I also felt so much self-judgement: "this is so cringe", "you are so dramatic," "all the writers you admire don't write like this", or "you just want attention."
So this post is why I think that, if you feel drawn to it, writing vulnerably may actually be a great idea. 
I'll start with why it pays to be honest about yourself, and then move onto how this applies to writing.

Hiding what you feel is very hard even when you carefully manage what you do or say.
One reason is that, in general, emotions still leak out through tiny facial expressions, mannerisms, posture, tone of voice, what you avoid (or indulge in), and even what you [observe](https://x.com/p_lafox/status/1847429431721107833). 
Another reason is that millions of years of evolution has hardwired us to look for these leaks, consciously or unconsciously, to try and figure out whether someone is safe or not[^1].
So, you might as well embrace your feelings in all their beauty, nastiness, and uncertainty. 

If you're a practical person, you might also note that hiding what you feel is not a very efficient way of living.
You spend all this time and energy building a delicate scaffolding that encases a "monstrous" part of you only to find that 1) your imagination did a great job at making it look worse than it actually was, and 2) most people don't care. 
In fact, they might even appreciate you let them know who you really are!

Disclaimer: 
None of this self-acceptance stuff means you're automatically allowed to punch your annoying co-worker because "you're just accepting your anger."
Or that you should go around trauma-dumping everyone you meet because you're "being honest."
There's real skill in safely expressing emotions and integrating hard experiences. 
But this post isn't about all that. 
This is about showing you why honesty about ones' feelings is a worthy practice.

Now to the good part: being vulnerable and honest about who we are and what feel is actually a superpower.
There's a certain security and attractiveness that one exudes when they stop trying to contort themselves into more acceptable versions of themselves. 
One reason for this could be that this may be a proxy for competence and emotional stability.
And that's probably a good starting point on also being able to take care of someone else. 
Another reason may be that complete honesty automatically relaxes you. 
Once you realize it's ok to feel and (skillfully) express anything, you stop trying to make things other than what they are.
And it's way more pleasant to be with someone who isn't constantly tugging at their existence.

So what does all this mean for writing? 
Well, recently I've felt very self-conscious about much of my writing.
This year I went through a brutal breakup, the death of my father, and overall a lot of LIFE.
And within all this I've felt and learned so much that all I want to do is write about love and gratitude and heartbreak and grief.
About all the meaning I've found. 
About all the wild woo woo stuff I've discovered in this wild "spiritual" journey
About how ALIVE I feel.

Yet, I often find myself immediately clamping down on this creativity hose. 
I feel fear that I'll become a stereotype of a spiritual person that runs around in circles.
That "I'm too young" to be talking about all this.
That I'll get distracted from truly "useful" work.
That I'll wander in a fractal forest of self-realization and deepening spirituality, always healing yet never healed.
And look, honestly, this is still something I still worry about. 
But, it's also become very clear that this IS who I am right now, whether I like it or not. 
My heart is spilling out a river of so much corny shit I want to share and I have two choices: 1) I can try to play whack-a-mole with my feelings or 2) I can let myself fall into the experience, write about it, maybe something fun will come out.

Because what else would I write about anyways?
Nietszsche said "of all that is written, I love only what a man write in his own blood. Write in blood and you will realize that blood is spirit."
How can we really write about anything but which was shaped our very understanding of existence?
There's no shortage of boring, observations. 
Let's go deep, let's explore something new! 
I'm done reading and hearing about stuff everyone can see. 
If it's cringey, so what?
And if it rubs some people the wrong way, so what? 
In fact, if what you're writing doesn't make at least a couple people cringe, recoil, or otherwise push away, it's probably not pushing up against any boundaries. 
But there's only way of finding out! 
So get out there and write something vulnerable. 
Tell me who YOU really are.

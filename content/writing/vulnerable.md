Here's something that's been on my mind lately: vulnerable writing.
Before you roll your eyes I'll just say what I think about it: vulnerable writing is the only writing you have.
I came to this conclusion after wrestling with writing about some deeply personal stuff, yet feeling a pull to be seen, and share all the beautiful things I've discovered. 
So, here's why I think that, if you feel drawn to it, writing vulnerably may be a good idea. 
I'll start with being honest about who you are, and move onto how this applies to writing.

Trying to hide what you're really feeling is not possible. 
Because, whether we like it or not, who we are is very obvious to most people around us. 
Our soft gooey interior leaks out in our mannerisms, how we speak, who we speak to and even our observations.
In fact, [simply revealing what you observe is almost as informative of what you're thinking.](https://x.com/p_lafox/status/1847429431721107833)
You may be able to hide it from some people who perhaps don't pay too much attention or those who simply don't care. 
But it will be immediately apparent to anyone you bring close to you.
And in any case, why become close to someone if you don't want them to get to know your real feelings.
So, you might as well embrace that soft scary side of you: in all its beauty, nastiness, and uncertainty. 

Hiding all the parts you hate about yourself is just an inefficient way of living.
You spend all this time and energy, building a delicate scaffolding that encases a "monstrous" part of you only to find that 1) your imagination did a great job at making it look worse than it actually was, and 2) most people don't care. 
In fact, they might even appreciate you let them know who you really where.
More on this later.  

Disclaimer: 
None of this self-acceptance stuff means you're automatically allowed to punch your annoying co-worker because "you're just accepting your anger". 
There's a skillful way of learning how to express all this. 
But the reason I bring this up is because I'm trying to make the case that, if done correctly, being honest about your emotions can truly upgrade your life.

For example, once being honest about honesty may be useful is because it automatically relaxes you. 
As you stop trying to make things other than what they are, we release a bunch of built up tension.

Being vulnerable and honest about who we are is also a superpower.
There's a certain security and attractiveness that one just exudes when they stop trying to contort themselves into more acceptable versions of themselves. 
One reason for this could be that this may be a proxy for competence: having a clear understanding of your capabilities means you can at the very least take good care of yourself. 
And that's probably a good starting point on being able to take care of someone else. 
Another reason might be that complete honesty automatically relaxes you. 
Once you realize it's ok to feel and (skillfully) express what you feel, you stop make things other than what they are.
And it's way more pleasant to be next to someone who isn't constantly tugging at their existence.

So what does all this mean for writing? 
Well, recently I've felt very self-conscious about much of my writing.
This year I went through a brutal breakup, the death of my father, and overall a lot of LIFE.
And I've found my writing overflowing with thoughts on love, gratitude, heartbreak, grief, and meaning. 
I've felt and learned so much and all I want to do is write about love and gratitude and heartbreak and grief.
About all the meaning I've found. 
About all the wild woo woo stuff I've discovered in this wild "spiritual" journey
About how ALIVE I feel.

Yet, very often, I find myself stamping it down. 
In panic that I'll just become this stereotype of a spiritual person that runs around in circles.
That "I'm too young" to be talking about all this
Scared that this will distract me from truly "useful" work.
That I'll just get stuck in a fractal forest of self-realization and deepening spirituality.
Always healing yet never healed.
And look, honestly, this is still something I still worry about. 
But, it's also become very clear that this IS who I am right now, whether I like it or not. 
My heart is spilling out a river of so much corny shit I want to share and I have two choices: 1) I can try to play whack-a-mole with my feelings or 2) I can let myself fall into it, write about it, maybe something beautiful will come out.

Because what else could we write about anyways?
Nietszsche said "Of all that is written, I love only what a man write in his own blood. Write in blood and you will realize that blood is spirit.
How can we really write about anything but what we've experience primally, in-person, directly?
There's no shortage of boring, observations. 
Let's go deep, let's explore something new! 
I'm done reading and hearing about stuff everyone can see. 
If it's cringey, so what?
And if it rubs some people the wrong way, so what? 
In fact, if what you're writing doesn't make at least a couple people cringe, recoil, or otherwise push away, it's probably not pushing up against any boundaries. 
But there's only way of finding out! 
So get out there and write something vulnerable. 
Tell me who YOU really are.

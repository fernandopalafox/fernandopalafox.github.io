So why is it that it seems so hard to open oneself up to the world wide web? 
Why does it feel necessary? 
Not sure, but there's a part of me that wants it. 
Someone on Twitter described it as allowing oneself to be seen without feeling like a burden. 
I wish I could find this tweet. 
Perhaps my biggest fear when doing all this is a bit of... shame? 
A feeling that if I open myself up, people will move away.
But I have a feeling that I don't really have a choice in the matter. 
How to describe this? 
I can either fight against it, or I can lean into it and embrace it. 
Regardless of what I do it seems like it's going to come out. 
So what is it that I'm afraid of? 

It's the longing for a belonging. 
A fear that we're not going to be ok. 
That if I say everyting about who I am, and who I am not... bad things will happen? 
People will move away? 
I guess if they do move away, they weren't meant to be part of this. 
But it seems to me like there is still some catharsis here. 
I do FEEL something. 
What is it? 
What is this desire? 
Perhaps a part of it is validation. 
A feeling that all these feelings are not in vain. 
BUt if they're not, why do they need someone else to look at them? 

I don't know. 
I'm rambling. 
It's ok. 
What I do want to do is say it, say what I'm so afraid of: 
One part of me is afraid that I'm some kind of depressive personality that just has a bad time, all the time. 
It's scary to think that. 
At the end of the day, I do have to accept that whatever is the case, I think and notice a lot of things. 
I also care a lot. 
I really do. 
And this feels me with great pain sometimes: I care about my parents, my friends, the strangers I meet. 
I want to understand and help these people. 
Sometimes I sense pain, I see patterns of behavior that I also went through and I want to do my best to change them. 
Althought I definitely think this is an area primed for projection, I don't think that I'm ONLY projecting. 
But the solution is not to go into people's lives.
People don't really help until they look for it themselves. 
People live in perpetual drunkness for a long time, not aware of the dreamstate they're in. 
And I'd like to help wake them up from that. 
Come with me! 
I don't have it figured out, but I can see a way out from that particular problem you have! 
Alas, some people don't want to be helped. 

But I guess, if I were to write and love those things that I'm afraid of, here they are: 
- That I'm a depressive person that will bring others down
- That I feel too much and I get easily overwhelmed
- That I'm afraid I'll be alone
- That I don't have what it takes to face the challenges in front of me. 
- That I'm not smart enough
- That I'm not physically attractive enough
- That I'm not funny enough

There, I said it. 
An ode to vulnerability. 
It's hard, but these insecuirites will leak out anyways.
In the way I act, in the people I approach, in the people I reach out to, in the way I speak. 
I might as well lean into them: spice up who I am. 
I've learned that we're all infinitely complex beings, and that bottling you up into an idea, a concept, a description of who you are is an impossible task. 
And even if it weren't, by the time I was finished writing down your description, it would already be out of date. 
So, no. 
I have no clue if other people feel this, I suspect I'm not the only one, but I can't know for sure. 
However, I can say this: I feel this. 
Every day.
Every action.
It's gonna leak out anways, so I might as well just say it. 
Why? 
Well, now ti strangely feels ok. 
It's cathartic. 
It lets it all out.

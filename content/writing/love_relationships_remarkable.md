**An obligation to do great things**

We have an obligation to do great things. 
Because the truth is, the world is a fragile place with unimaginable amounts of suffering, and it won't get any better by itself. 
Things don't just happen by default, built it.
It took the great work and sacrifice of many people to build the world we have today. 
We have many, many problems to fix, but the truth of the matter is that the world has never been a better place. 
And there is also no middle: if you're not making the world a better place, you're actively dragging down those who are.

Greatness may sound intimidating, but it may be a lot more straightforward than you realize.
I define greatness as whatever you can do to reduce the amount of suffering in the world. 
Perhaps greatness for you is to raise a family. 
Perhaps it's to spend some of your time volunteering at a local shelter. 
At the end of the day, everyone has a role in the world. 
You are responsible for yourself, because if you don't take care of yourself, someone else will. 
Although this may sound counterintuitive to some people, greatness may involve a great deal of self-care. 
Because if you don't take care of yourself, eventually, someone else will have to. 
This means that greatness for you may mean brushing your teeth, making your bed every morning, or exercising for a bit. 
Or, perhaps it is literally to change the world. 
Orient yourself towards truth, no matter how uncomfortable, break down the steps, and you will find what it is you should do next. 
Aiming high is accesible to everyone, but only if you are honest with yourself. 
Perhaps aiming high means taking stock of the situation and looking around you. 

Whatever greatness means for you, you have a duty to pursue it. 
Because life is hard, and if you can't rest easy knowing that you did your best, no matter the sacrifice, you will end up bitter and resentful. 
If you avoid aiming for greatness, you will inevitably try to bring down all those who do, because they will remind you of the dreams you gave up on. 
They will remind you of the sacrifices you were not willing to make.

"We regret the things we didn't do more than the things we did. 
The pain of trying and failying may be intense but at least it tends to be over rather quickly. 
The pain of failintg to try, on the other hand, is less intense but neer really goes away." 

**Being**

When you're ripped away from the warm embrace of innocence you have two choices: get scared and 

That real life can be terrifying and brutal. 

It is getting terrified by the immensity and the brutality of Being, and deciding to do it scared. 

It means accepting the resentment that's felt after being ripped away from innocence

That the only way back to innocence is to try and blind oneself. 

It is learning that cynical person will become selfishness and destroy those who are trying to make it.

It is the understanding, to your bones, that change is the only constant. 

It is looking at the mirror, accepting all your flaws

It is understanding how special and delicate our existence is

It is understanding that wishing for the present to be anything but what it is, only leads to pain

It is learning that we dont choose whether we believe or not, we choose what to believe in. And this is likely the most important decision we'll ever make. Choose incorrectly and the hardships of life will drown you in hopelessness, resentment, and arrogance. 

That attachment really is the source of all suffering. 

It is realizing that the the world exists in a delicate balance between progress and decay. There is no in between. 

That the sooner you let go of who you think you are, the sooner you'll find who you actually are. 

That everything really is a skill issue. 

That what is expedient is not what matters. 

That you can only properly listen by letting go of pride. 

That you are the only person responsible for your own happiness.

That it takes effort to maintain any emotion. They literally all go away on their own after a bit. 

The lack of certainty makes it worth it. 

> "If i know what I shall find, I do not want to find it. Uncertainty is the salf of life" - Erwin Chargaff

No one is more keenly aware of our faults than ourselves. So treat yourself with kindness. 

You aren't the best judge of what you need. And it is easy to delude yourself into believing what you need. 
- Most of the time, we're not the best judges for what is best for us. And if we ever do get it, it can quickly turn into an addictive dependence. 
Fortunately, what's best for us is generally accesible, but only if we can let go of our identities. 
Of the idea we hold on how we should act, who we should be, what we should do, who should like us, who you talk to, who follows you, who you follow. 

Small problems sweeped under a rug will grow into legitimate chaos if you don't face them. 

**Relationships**


It is learning that not everyone can be trusted

It is learning that parents make mistakes too

It is learning that kindness is always the appropriate response.

It is understanding that Solzhenitsyn was right when he said that "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained"

It is learning that some people simply do not want to be helped

That it's easier to be dragged down than it is to pull someone up
That some people don't believe that they deserve any better or don't want the trouble of getting to it. 

It is understanding that self-sacrifice for someone else's wellbeing can paradoxically be completely selfish. 

It is learning that you can only get stepped on if you lay down.

It is understanding that ceaseless motion may hide problems, but it won't fix them.

That you really have no choice over what you feel. 

That good friends will not tolerate cynicism or destructiveness. 

That good friends will, in a painful process, carve out the bad, the mediocre, the bad. 

That it's harder to surround yourself by good people than bad people

That bad friends will drag you down as your success shines a light on their faults. 


**Love**
It is learning that we don't choose who we love. 

It is learning that opening one's heart cannot be done at a safe distance.
It is learning that opening one's heart is always worth it.

That it's beautiful we ever fall in love enough to get heartbroken.

That when you put someone on a pedestal, you fall in love with your idea of them. And that places undue pressure on them. 


"The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance"

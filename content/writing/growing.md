I'm 25. Here's a list of lessons I've learned in the past year. 

**Truth**

I've learned that the life of most meaning is the one with the most adventure. And the life with the most adventure is the one that follows truth. 

What is truth? It is whatever you see, say, or feel when you let go who you think you are, how you think things should be, how you think things should feel. 

Truth is what you see when you look at the mirror. 

It's what you see when you are humble enough to look at your shadow. 

It is the way people treat you. 

It is the way people look at you. 

It is your career. 

It is not what you wish things would be

It is not the life you wish you had

It is not potential. 

Truth is what you see when you sit still and pay attention. 

It is what you see when you try something and fail.

When you live in truth, you feel the force of reality behind you. 

When you speak the truth, you let go of consequences. 




But living in truth is hard! We do not control the truth. 

But one can only speak the truth if they can let go of the consequences. 

That speaking the truth will always be risky. But it's riskier not to. 

That sadly, That it's easier not to think, not to do, and not to care. 

Realizing that we're not best judges of what's best for us

That growing up is infinitely more painful that stagnating


That the only way of seeing the truth is to fail.

That asking yourself: "why did this fail?" is not enough. You must also want the answer. 


**Being**

It is getting terrified by the immensity and the brutality of Being, and deciding to do it scared. 

It means accepting the resentment that's felt after being ripped away from innocence

That the only way back to innocence is to try and blind oneself. 

It is learning that cynical person will become selfishness and destroy those who are trying to make it.

It is the understanding, to your bones, that change is the only constant. 

It is looking at the mirror, accepting all your flaws

It is understanding how special and delicate our existence is

It is understanding that wishing for the present to be anything but what it is, only leads to pain

It is learning that we dont choose whether we believe or not, we choose what to believe in. And this is likely the most important decision we'll ever make. Choose incorrectly and the hardships of life will drown you in hopelessness, resentment, and arrogance. 

That attachment really is the source of all suffering. 

It is realizing that the the world exists in a delicate balance between progress and decay. There is no in between. 

That the sooner you let go of who you think you are, the sooner you'll find who you actually are. 

That everything really is a skill issue. 

That what is expedient is not what matters. 

That you can only properly listen by letting go of pride. 

That you are the only person responsible for your own happiness.

**Relationships**

It is accepting that what's best for you is only accessible if only you let go of your identity. 

It is learning that not everyone can be trusted

It is learning that parents make mistakes too

It is learning that kindness is always the appropriate response.

It is understanding that Solzhenitsyn was right when he said that "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained"

It is learning that some people simply do not want to be helped

That it's easier to be dragged down than it is to pull someone up
That some people don't believe that they deserve any better or don't want the trouble of getting to it. 

It is understanding that self-sacrifice for someone else's wellbeing can paradoxically be completely selfish. 

It is learning that you can only get stepped on if you lay down.

It is understanding that ceaseless motion may hide problems, but it won't fix them.

That you really have no choice over what you feel. 

That good friends will not tolerate cynicism or destructiveness. 

That good friends will, in a painful process, carve out the bad, the mediocre, the bad. 

That it's harder to surround yourself by good people than bad people

That bad friends will drag you down as your success shines a light on their faults. 

**Love**
It is learning that we don't choose who we love. 

It is learning that opening one's heart cannot be done at a safe distance.
It is learning that opening one's heart is always worth it.

That it's beautiful we ever fall in love enough to get heartbroken.

That when you put someone on a pedestal, you fall in love with your idea of them. And that places undue pressure on them.

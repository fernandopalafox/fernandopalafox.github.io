Growing up is accepting that best life is that with the most adventure. And the life with the most adventure is the one that follows Truth. 

But one can only speak the truth if they can let go of the consequences. 

That speaking the truth will always be risky. But it's riskier not to. 

That sadly, That it's easier not to think, not to do, and not to care. 

Realizing that we're not best judges of what's best for us

That growing up is infinitely more painful that stagnating

It is looking at the mirror, accepting all your flaws

It is getting terrified by the immensity of Being, and deciding to do it scared. 

It means accepting the resentment that's felt after being ripped away from naivete

It is accepting that what's best for you is only accesible if only you let go of your identity. 

It is the understanding, to your bones, that change is the only constant. 

It is learning that not everyone can be trusted

It is learning that we don't choose who we love. 

It is learning that opening one's heart cannot be done at a safe distance
It is learning that opening one's heart is worth it

It is learning that kindness is always the appropriate response

It is understanding that Solzhenitsyn was right when he said that "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained"

It is understanding how special our delicate our existence is

It is understanding that wishing anything but what is, is the path to pain. 

It is realizing that the the world exists in a delicate balance between progress and decay. There is no in between. 

It is learning that some people simply do not want to be helped

That it's easier to be dragged down than it is to pull someone up

That some people don't believe that they deserve any better or don't want the trouble of getting to it. 

It is understanding that self-sacrifice for someone else's wellbeing can paradoxically be completely selfish. 

It is learning that you can only get stepped on if you lay down.

It is learning that we dont choose whether we believe or not, we choose what to believe in. And this is likely the most important decision you'll ever make. Choose incorrectly and the hardships of life will drown you in hopelessness, resentment, and arrogance. 

It is understanding that ceaseless motion may hide problems, but it won't fix them

That you really have no choice over what you feel. 

That attachment really is the source of all suffering. 

That the source of suffering really is attachment

It is learning that love is not blind, it just plays dumb

That if you live in truth, you will feel the force of reality behind you.

That the only way back to innocence is to try and blind oneself. 

It is llearning that cynicism 

That the only way of seeing the truth is to 

That asking yourself: "why did this fail?" is not enough. You must also want to the answer. 

That everything really is a skill issue. 

That the sooner you let go of who you think you are, the sooner you'l find you actually are. 

That what is expedient is not what matters. 

That good friends will not tolerate cynicism or destructiveness. 

That it's harder to surround yourself by good people than bad people

That bad friends will drag you down as your success shines a light on their faults. 

That you can only properly listen by letting go of pride. 

That the only person responsible for your own happiness is yourself. 

That when you put someone on a pedestal, you fall in love with your idea of them. And that places undue pressure on them.

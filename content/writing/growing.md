Here are a couple lessons I've learned in the past couple of months
They're grouped into three topics: [Truth](#truth), [Being](#being), and [relationships](#relationships). 

**Truth**

The life of most meaning is the one with the most adventure, and the life with the most adventure is the one that follows truth. 
Truth is the ultimate adventure because it does not depend on what you know, like, think, or want. 
It is completely out of your control. 
But by definition, it is the most real thing there is.
However, it is not all perfect. 
Because truth isn't always nice. 
Truth is what you see, say, or feel when you let go who you think you are, how you think things should be, how you think things should feel. 
Truth is what you see when you look at the mirror. It's what you see when you are humble enough to look at the shadow you pretend doesn't exist. It is the way people treat you. It is the way you look. It is your career. It is not what you wish things would be, it's what they actually are. It is not potential, it is what you've done. Truth is what you see when you sit still and pay attention. It is what you see when you try something and fail. 

When you speak the truth, you let go of consequences. 
Living in truth is hard! We do not control it, we have no say over its consequences, but it is always there. 
And when you live in truth, you can let go and feel the force of reality behind you. 

Living in Truth does mean living a passive life of existence. In fact, most of the times it's the opposite. Most of the times, when you dare look at Truth, it becomes immediately apparent what your flaws are. Where you can improve, what you've done wrong, how you can be better. And it's actually easier to ignore it. In fact, the bar to be better than most people at getting the truth is ridicuoulousy low. Because is easier not to think, not to do, and not to care. It is easier to stagnate, to ignore, to pretend. 
But the riskiest thing is to ignore the truth. 
Because the force of reality stands behind truth. 
And no fiction, no mental gymnastics, no amount of distortion, pleasure, or gaslighting will ever stop reality. 
Any tiny bit of uncomfortable truth you sweep under a rug will always grow into legimitate chaos if you don't face it   . 
Atonement when straying from truth will require sacrifice, and let this dragon grow to big, and the sacrifice may take everything from you. 
Perhaps not today. Perhaps not tomorrow. But I guarantee whatever dragon comes out of it will be much harder to deal with. 

Live in truth and you will find meaning in the most mundane tasks in life. 
Take a moment, pause for a second and pay attention to whatever you have been hiding ignoring or pretending doesn't exist.
Almost like magic, you will know what right thing to do next is.
And it may actually be something simple, like, get off your phone and go to bed so you can wakeup early the next day to workout. 
Or it could be something major: confess a lie, end an important relationship, change your job.  

Live in Truth and you will understand that aiming for greatness is both accessible and necessary for everyone. 
Accesible because anyone can always aim to be a better person, to make the world around them a better place, to sacrifice what they can to minimize suffering to the world. 
Perhaps greatness for you is to raise a family. 
Perhaps it's to spend some of your time volunteering at a local shelter. 
Perhaps it's to change the world. 
Whatever greatness means for you, you have a duty to pursue it. 
Life is hard, if you can't rest easy knowing that you gave it everything you had, no matter the sacrifice, then you will be left a bitter and resentful person. 
And from there on, the only path forward is one of selfishness and destruction. 
You will resent those who tried, even if they failed. 

Take a moment  to look for Truth in your life. Pause for a second and pay attention and you will find a clear path in front of you 
Perhaps it's something mundane, something small. l

- Most of the time, we're not the best judges for what is best for us. And if we ever do get it, it can quickly turn into an addictive dependence. 
Fortunately, what's best for us is generally accesible, but only if we can let go of our identities. 
Of the idea we hold on how we should act, who we should be, what we should do, who should like us, who you talk to, who follows you, who you follow. 


That asking yourself: "why did this fail? How can I be better? How can I get better"  is not enough. You must also want the answer. 

Small problems sweeped under a rug will grow into legitimate chaos if you don't face them. 

Embracing Truth will require sacrifice. 

**Being**

When you're ripped away from the warm embrace of innocence you have two choices: get scared and 

That real life can be terrifying and brutal. 

It is getting terrified by the immensity and the brutality of Being, and deciding to do it scared. 

It means accepting the resentment that's felt after being ripped away from innocence

That the only way back to innocence is to try and blind oneself. 

It is learning that cynical person will become selfishness and destroy those who are trying to make it.

It is the understanding, to your bones, that change is the only constant. 

It is looking at the mirror, accepting all your flaws

It is understanding how special and delicate our existence is

It is understanding that wishing for the present to be anything but what it is, only leads to pain

It is learning that we dont choose whether we believe or not, we choose what to believe in. And this is likely the most important decision we'll ever make. Choose incorrectly and the hardships of life will drown you in hopelessness, resentment, and arrogance. 

That attachment really is the source of all suffering. 

It is realizing that the the world exists in a delicate balance between progress and decay. There is no in between. 

That the sooner you let go of who you think you are, the sooner you'll find who you actually are. 

That everything really is a skill issue. 

That what is expedient is not what matters. 

That you can only properly listen by letting go of pride. 

That you are the only person responsible for your own happiness.

That it takes effort to maintain any emotion. They literally all go away on their own after a bit. 

The lack of certainty makes it worth it.

**Relationships**


It is learning that not everyone can be trusted

It is learning that parents make mistakes too

It is learning that kindness is always the appropriate response.

It is understanding that Solzhenitsyn was right when he said that "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained"

It is learning that some people simply do not want to be helped

That it's easier to be dragged down than it is to pull someone up
That some people don't believe that they deserve any better or don't want the trouble of getting to it. 

It is understanding that self-sacrifice for someone else's wellbeing can paradoxically be completely selfish. 

It is learning that you can only get stepped on if you lay down.

It is understanding that ceaseless motion may hide problems, but it won't fix them.

That you really have no choice over what you feel. 

That good friends will not tolerate cynicism or destructiveness. 

That good friends will, in a painful process, carve out the bad, the mediocre, the bad. 

That it's harder to surround yourself by good people than bad people

That bad friends will drag you down as your success shines a light on their faults. 


**Love**
It is learning that we don't choose who we love. 

It is learning that opening one's heart cannot be done at a safe distance.
It is learning that opening one's heart is always worth it.

That it's beautiful we ever fall in love enough to get heartbroken.

That when you put someone on a pedestal, you fall in love with your idea of them. And that places undue pressure on them. 



That if any of these comments gave you a negative reaction, it's probably because it's true ;)

"The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance"

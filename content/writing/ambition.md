title: Ambition and serenity 
draft: true
---

This is a brief note about my thoughts on reconciling ambition and serenity. 
Ambition is the desire to do or achieve something hard, perhaps something that has never been done before, perhaps something that can't be done according to conventional wisdom. 
Ambition is a fundamental part of who I am.^[1]
Serenity is the state of peace and calm that gets me through high-stress situations. 
My teens and early twenties were marked with severe phases of self-doubt and depression (many such cases), and I found that growing of out that phase largely happened when I internalized the Stoic attitude of *amor fati*: a love of fate, and an understanding of our capacity to attribute any meaning to any situation, good or bad. 
Marcus Aurelius recognized the power of this attitude when he said that 
> a blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.

Leaning on *amor fati* helped me navigate periods of stress and/or uncertainty, but recently, I ran into what felt like a paradox: ambition necessarily requires a desire to change the status quo driven by some kind of discomfort.
On the other hand, *amor fati* is all about being ok with the status quo by choosing to interpret it in the best way possible. 
Both ideas seem contradictory, yet, they both feel important, so this note is about how I bring them together

My solution is simple: 
1. Select ambitious goals challenge conventional wisdom on what can and can't be done.
2. Bias yourself towards doing (rather than thinking), and work **hard**. 
3. Along the way, keep your ego in check so that you can learn new things.
4. Reflect on what you learn to calibrate where you spend time and energy. 
5. Goto 1.
   
Inevitably, you will find yourself in periods of great uncertainty, particularly when working on something that's really interesting or novel. 
I find serenity through these periods by doings things well. 
When working towards a goal, if I know that I went all-in and pushed myself to the limit, then, at least for a moment, I can sit back in peace and love whatever life throws at me next. *Amor fati*. 

Working hard looks different for everyone. 
For me, it looks like uninterrupted periods of [deep work](writing/deepwork) followed by reflection over any learned lessons. 
I usually aim to distill my experience into what worked, what didn't, why that was the case, and what the logical next steps are. 
I also make an earnest effort to reflect on what I can do better. 
This can be painful, especially if an idea I developed and worked hard on does not work as expected (or at all).
However, these reflections are critical to avoid wasting time by going in circles, and they also help me get a better idea of where my time/energy is best spent.

Periods of reflection should emphasize error-correction, not errors. 
The former sets you up for unbounded improvement, the latter can quickly become self-destructive. 
In any case, these reflections should not take up much time (a mistake I've done before), lest they shift your bias from doing to thinking. 

Select your goals from first principles.
If a goal is not prohibited by the laws of physics, then don't worry about how crazy it sounds, and proceed as if its possible unless proven otherwise. 
This doesn't mean you should go for any idea that hasn't yet been proven wrong.
You still need *some* reason to believe why your crazy idea may work [^2].
A related skill is the ability to discern when something is not working. 
Learning this skill requires keeping your ego in check.   
After all, innovation is a delicate balance between being open-minded but also unreasonably stubborn.^[3]
And the only way you get better at this, is by iterating through lots of ideas and never stop learning. 

Be an optimist.
Optimism will get you through the hard times because it's easier to come up with creative solutions to temporary road-blocks if you're optimistic about the driving idea. 
And, if your idea is ambitious enough, optimism will naturally expose you to massive upsides if your idea works i.e., [a positive Black Swan](https://www.wealest.com/articles/positive-black-swan).
 
I can't write about serenity without mentioning the Serenity Prayer: 
> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

My previous thoughts pertain mostly to the acquisition of that elusive "wisdom to know the difference." 
Combining ambition and *amor fati* does not mean a searching for the ultimate wisdom that can differentiate between what can and cannot be changed with perfection - I don't think that even exists [^4].
Instead, the idea is to leverage the rocking motion between the driving discomfort of ambition and the clarity of serenity to learn the best error-correction heuristics, and improve indefinitely. 

I'll end this note with my current ambitions (as of 2023/11/24)
1. Figure out how to build [creative robots](https://twitter.com/p_lafox/status/1714798989965451596) that make everyday people's lives better. 
2. To do so, leverage my background in aerospace engineering and become an expert in control, game theory, and machine learning. Instead of aiming to be better than 99% of people at any single topic, I aim to be better than 90% at all three. 
3. Along the way learn a bit about what makes humans special and why we are so unique. 

[^1] I like to think deeply about many things in my life, but I've found that it's best for me not to ask too many questions about things that give me meaning. It muddies the water too much, especially when it's something I don't have the technical/intellectual chops to write cogently about. If something *feels* like it gives me meaning, then it does. This attitude came from very valuable conversations with [Dr. Andrea Kowalchuck](https://www.colorado.edu/herbst/andrea-kowalchuk), a professor for an ethics course I took during my undergraduate years. I love people, I love humanity, and I find meaning in understanding our universe and making stuff that makes people's lives better. That's it.

[^2] Based on what I've read and heard, crazy ideas that end up working are commonly found by people with [specific knowledge](https://nav.al/specific-knowledge) about a particular topic. They've spent enough time working on something to find gaps in conventional knowledge and pursue ideas that seem crazy to an outsider. Note that I've yet to go through this process myself, as I'm still developing my personal specific knowledge, so don't quote me on this and I'll report back in a couple years.

What is the purpose of this reflection? Talk about how I approach ambition and amor fati. 

I've recently spent time pondering about how to best manage the tension between ambition and a contentedness with ones current situation, or *amor fati*.
Ambition, necessarily requires a degree of discomfort with the status quo, and a desire to change it. 
On the other hand, one of the most powerful tools I've recently discovered is the Stoic idea that we have the capacity to interpret situations in whatever favorable way we want. 
On the other hand, yet I've also found that so much in life does not depend on us, that you;re in for a lot of pain if you try to change everything in your life. 

There's a subtelty here though and I'm pretty young, but this is my conjecture: part of growing older and wiser is the wisdom to understand this difference. 
But there's a catch, the world is more malleable than most people realize, and sometimes, believing that you can change something that common knowledge deems otherwise, is all it it takes. 

This is all encapsulated in the Serenity Prayer: 
> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

Wise people have the wisdom to know the difference, but this wisdom is a double-edged sword: once you settle into a a way of thinking, it's hard to find ways of making it better. 
This is precisely why newer generations may not have the techinical chops and/or experience of an established individual, but are still able to bring new ideas to the table: They don't carry the same mimetic baggage and inherently approach problems from a new perspective. 
So I guess, the probem becomes, learn from existing knowledge about what can and can't be changed, but follow your instincts when you sense that a conventionally static idea may not be so static after all, particularly if it's an area you are new to, since your freshness unburdens you from the mimetic baggage that established people are carrying. 
Once you have one of these ideas, poke into it thoroughly, chances are something new will show up. 

So perhaps this note should be about combining amibition and wisdom, but not too much. On the one hand, too much wisdom petrifies and constrains your universe. 
And that's not how progress is made. 
But too much ambition, particularly if you point it at the wrong things, wil waste energy on useless things. 


A bit of background on how this came about. 
Growing up, I knew two things: first I quickly understood that I had a unique situation in life: I had two loving parents who worked their asses off the provide the best opportunitines to me, and 2

This is a question I keep asking myself. Something that I've only recently learned about myself. I feel like I have potential and I want to make the best of it. Working towards big goals and ideas is how I find meaning in life. But growing up, I had slightly neuorotic tendencies. I had a bias towards extreme self-doubt and depressive episodes. I was always a big thinking without enough doing, so I ended up paying a lot of attention to my own thoughts. I discovered the world and sometime around my second or third year of undergrad I established a semi-regular practice of [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha-vipassana) meditation. I found great solace in my practice and around the same time started to learn about the [stoics](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736) thanks to an absolutely fantastic book my dad found at the Boulder Bookstore[^1]

Through meditation adn the stoics I found myself learning to be at ease with my thoughts. I learned about the passing nature of feelings and I learned how to avoid identifying myself with every emotion going through my head. Through the end of my undergraduate degree and the start of graduate school, I found myself in a lot life uncertainty as I tried to figure out what I wanted to do (and I had a couple of really dark moments), and I found great solace in the stoic idea of *amor fati* or love of fate. I had to swallow the pill that so much about life is just not under our control, and so much of "success" is just luck. For the first time, I felt peace in not worrying about absolutely everything and just letting things be. Saying like the serenity prayer became a mantra for me. It was all life-changing for the good. 

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

But now, I'm at a crossroads. Now that I've learned a little more about ambition and grown more confident in my abilities, pivoting into the real of rapid iteration into things I'm interested in, growing more confident at my abilities. On the one hand, I have grown confident enough to believe that I can achieve great things. As an engineer, I'd like to aim to solve great questions. Yet, this ambition requires standing at odds with the current state of the world. As George Bernard Shaw once said: 
> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
> 
And having the unreasonable-ness in oneself requires a degree of suffering that would ostensibly be gone if one were to blindly believe in *amor fati*. 

How does one manage this tension? I can only speak from personal perspective, but I think the key idea is to focus on productive unreasonableness. **Focus on changing what the laws of nature do not prohibit. And learn to be ok with the rest.** Concretely, and this is something I'm still learning to do myself, use discomfort to channel your energy into new iterations. For example, in the past I spent a lot of time pondering on the nature of hard problems, for example, how hard it is to come up with original and useful ideas during the PhD process. I think the key is to identify this angst, and do something about it, and then learn to be happy with whatever happens next. Be content with the idea that you tried to the absolute best of your abilities. Then learn to love the rest, because its mostly out of your control. 

Other ideas I should include
- Deep Work by Cal Newport
- Combine amor fati with hunger to make the world a better place.
- In a recent podcast I heard with Marc Andressen (might've been Lex or Huberman), he said something about how being an entrepreneur is like repeatedly getting punched in the face and eventually liking the taste of your own blood. Part of it, I think, is adopting the mindset of amor fati. Nothing is good or bad, it just is. Only you choose to interpret it as good or bad.


[^1] In the interest of completeness, because of my great appreciation to these people, I'd like to mention the two people that first introduced me to meditation and the stoics. I first heard about meditation through conversations with Ely Seiryu Rayek in my early teens.  ([here's a link to a talk he gave](https://zmm.org/podcast/ceaseless-becoming/)), a therapists I'd talk to with semi-regularly. I actually never got into the practice while I was working with him, but his calm and collected demeanor left a permanent impression in my mind I never forgot. And a lot of the way I deal with stress today is thanks to him. 
Onto the stoics, I first learned about them in a high school literature class taught by Juan Antonio Pacheco where we read and discussed Seneca's *Letters from a Stoic*. I distinctly remember how impressed I was by the timelessness of Seneca's ideas and I knew I had to read more. Alas, like I said, I was a thinker, not a doer, and it took me a couple more years to follow up on that interest.

A couple months ago I read [this X by Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1694385101755343212) where he included the following quote by George Bernard Shaw: 

> ‘The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.’

It struck me to the core and I immediately began to share it with everyone I knew. 
It made all the sense in the world, and it aligned with everything I've learned about scientific and cultural progress. 
Namely, how it tends to come from people at the fringes of the current zeitgeist. 
So, like Ek, I adopted this as a guiding motto. 
And At the beginning, it went wonderfully, as I began to give myself permission to say and act in ways that I would not have previously done for fear of being judged by other people. 
Here I am, a couple months later, and I have a couple observations to share. 

Resistance to new ideas is typically expected from older generations, but it can be extremely disorienting when it comes from a friend or significant other. 
Teenage years gives one plenty of practice on debating with parents, teachers, or mentors on how one's idea 
This is harder when the push back comes from someone, whom presumably, was aligned in how you thought. 
And, if the idea digs deep enough, it can, with immediate effect, create an emotional rift with a person you care deeply about. 

Being unreasonable is hard. 
Most people, especially young people, like an element of adventure or weirdness in their lives. 
But get too weird, make people question some of their fundamental beliefs, and you risk alienating them.
And after all, we will never stop being social animals, and feeling lonely can be hard. 
Believing and acting on a truly new idea will likely take immense courage and strength to hold steady in the stormy seas social and emotional pressure. 
You will be alone and scared. 
Fortunately, if you have a good reason to believe in this idea, the seas will eventually clear. 

Finally, one can and should choose where to be unreasonable. 
Pick a problem, a field, and dig to its core in search of truth, no matter how different, wrong, or scary the idea might be. 
One can never presume to know everything, and if the search of truth and progress is really the reason you're being unreasonable, you should welcome criticism and discussion, and this will always require one to be reasonable in listening and making an effort to understand opposing views. 
Being unreasonable and disagreeable about everything people say is a recipe for turning into a sour, resentful, and likely unhappy person. 

Personally, I would describe the effect of this mindset as intense yet extremely formative. 
In the wake of my search for truth about the things I care and I find meaning in, some relationships I cared deeply about have unravelled. 
This process of reflection has been painful, and there is going back. 
Drake alludes to this in his 
> "I been losing friends and finding peace
But honestly that sounds like a fair trade to me"
Fortunately, I have also never before felt such a deep sense of purpose for what I was put on this world to do. 
I don't think 

As teenagers, we get plenty of sparring practice in debating and fighting against parents, teachers or mentors on how new ideas. 
After all, what are teenage years if not a training camp of contrarianism against any and every suggestions by ones' elders? 
Reading something like Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* primes you to expect some resistance to new ideas or behaviors from older generations. 
This is easy to understand, too. 
People with more experience are set in their ways of understanding and relating to the world, and likely have a bias towards when a young whippersnapper shows up with a fancy new idea it's
Perhaps my first surprising observation was that 

I grew up in Mexico, and even though I am extremely grateful for my upbringing, the culture there never really teaches you to approach things this way. 
I have found that many people, especially young people, appreciate a bit of weirdness. 
Enough to make them feel adventorous, but 
Many people, especially young people, appreciate likes a bit of weirdness, enough to make them feel adventorous but 
First of all, I definitely overcorrected into bein

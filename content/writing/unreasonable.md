A couple months ago I read [this post](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1694385101755343212) by Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek where he shared a quote by George Bernard Shaw: 

> "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."

It aligned with everything I've learned about scientific and cultural progress, and how it typically comes from people at the fringes of the current zeitgeist. 
So, like Ek, I adopted this as a guiding motto. 
It immediately had a positive effect on my life as I began to give myself permission to say and act in ways that I would not have previously done for fear of being judged by others. 
And to my pleasant surprise, this opened many new doors. 
However, I also had some surprising and unexpected experiences, so here I include some of my observations.

When being unreasonable, resistance to new ideas is typically expected from older generations, but it can be extremely disorienting when it comes from a friend or significant other. 
Teenage years gives one plenty of practice debating with parents, teachers, or mentors on the merits of one's idea.
Unfortunately, negative reactions to a new idea can be much harder to deal with when they come from someone, whom presumably, you were well intellectually well-aligned. 
And, if the idea digs deep enough, it can, with immediate effect, create an emotional rift with a person you care deeply about. 

Being unreasonable is hard. 
Most people, especially young people, like an element of adventure or weirdness in their lives. 
But get too weird, make people question some of their fundamental beliefs, and you risk alienation.
And for most people, the ensuing feelings of loneliness or isolation will not be easy. 
Believing and acting on a truly new idea will likely take immense courage and strength to hold steady in the stormy seas of social and emotional pressure. 
You will be alone and scared. 
Fortunately, if you have a good reason to believe in your idea, and follow through with it, the storm **will** clear out.

Progress requires a delicate balance of unreasonable ideas forged by reasonable discussions.
Pick a problem and dig to its core in search of truth, no matter how different, wrong, or scary the idea might sound. 
Be truly unreasonable in this search for truth but never forget that discussion and criticism is where great ideas are formed.
And engaging in productive discussions will require a degree of agreeableness so that you can properly listen and understand other perspectives.
Discussions this kind will most likely result in an improved version of your original idea. 

Finally, one can and should choose where to be unreasonable. 
Pick a couple things you truly care about and go all-in on them.
And for everything else, just let things be. 
Being unreasonable and disagreeable about everything is only a recipe for becoming a bitter, resentful, and likely very unhappy person.

Personally, I would describe the effect of George Bernard Shaw's idea on me as extremely formative. 
In my search for truth about the things I care and I find meaning in, some relationships I cared deeply about have unravelled. 
This process has been painful, but there is no other way.
I am reminded of [Drake's "Fair Trade"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THVbtGqEO1o):
> "I been losing friends and finding peace 
> But honestly that sounds like a fair trade to me"

And, although much work remains to be done, calmer seas are prevailing, and I now find myself with a sense of meaning and purpose like never before.

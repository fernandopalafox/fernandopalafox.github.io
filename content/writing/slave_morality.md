Recently been deepening my meditation practice, sitting between 30-60 minutes a day, listening to a bunch of Dharma talks on the Waking Up app (currently going through Joseph Goldstein's The Path of Insight), and reading some of the literature (current book is Thích Nhất Hạnh's *The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching*), and visiting the Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple once a week (I'm here for a summer internship).
I can mostly report positive effects: increase focus, anxiety has mostly vanished (never thought I'd say this lol), an easier time dealing with tough emotions, and waaay more patience, both with myself and other people. 
I've also had some interesting experiences: I had a period of a couple weeks where I would get extremely hot during practice, as in, dripping sweat by the time I was done. 
I also had one time where I heart a sharp wooden crack, almost like a massive branch had just broken, yet it didn't sound like the listening happened in my ears, because everything my ears could hear was quiet. 
Or the time when I began hearing a deep thumping sound, almost like war drums in the background, that completely disapeared once I finished the sit and opened my eyes.   
I've also had some "bad" experiences: for example, I've become keenly aware of much anger and frustration that's aimed at myself. 
I've always put a lot of pressure on myself, so tthese feelings towards myself are not entirely unexpected, but they're can also be quite jarring. 
Like, damn, I don't think I would talk like that to my worst enemy (yeah, it's that bad lol). 
Of course, the physical bits: I have soooo much tension built up in my neck and shoulders and it can be surprisingly painful during some sits. 
Extended time in cross-leggeed sits has also made it very obvious I am not as flexibile as I thought. 

But perhaps the "roughest" experience has been my glimpses into the impermanence of experience: all thoughts and emotion rises and floats away, and the feeling of self does too.
And in those moments of noticing this and sitting in the awareness that's left behind I find myself left with a feeling of emptiness? 
Things are great in the moment, but as soon as I get carrier away by some thought, and "I" notice what just happened, I feel a whole body contraction that feels very close to panic. 
At these moments, my mental dialogue goes something like this: "What do you mean "I" was gone?! Where did it go? How did you ever let that happen? You could've lost control!"
Another way of describing what this is like is a cramping muscle that is slowly relaxing until it's compeltely stretched out again, but suddenly, perhaps you move too fast, it cramps again, and more fiercelyl and painfully than the first time. 

Based on my understanding of what's going on, this is just a conditioned response of the ego. 
Specifically, 25 years of identifying with the feeling of self, and letting it go, relaxing that cramping muscle, is obviously something that takes time. 
But the experience has been rattling enough to where it's made me question the practice as a whole. 
I've found myself questioning whether I even want the prize for winning the game (i.e., [awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism))? 
What is this prize anyways? 
Does it end in becoming a shapeless blob of equanimity? 
Immune to joy or suffering, the archetypical stone-faced monk?  
But, hold on, is that even what awakening is like at all?
Note sure. 

Another source of doubt is inspired in part by a book I read recently Nietszche's *Beyond Good and Evil*. 
In it he describes slave morality[^1], a hierarchy of values formed by the "have-nots" in reaction to oppression by the "haves".
Under slave morality, one celebrates "those qualities which serve to make easier the existence of the suffering. [Such as] pity, the kind and helping hand, the warm heart, patience, industriousness, humility, [and] friendliness. [...] for here these are the most useful qualities and virtually the only means of enduring the burden of existence."
When living by Nietszche's slave morality, one seeks to convince himself that the happiness of the opressors is not genuine among them. 
I agree with all of those qualities, and practice meditation to ease my suffering, so does this mean I'm taking part in slave morality? 
Well, if that were the case, what's so wrong about that? 
Less suffering for me and qualities which help me make the world better, right? 
Well, slave morality comes from a place of deep resentment. 
It's a way of avoiding a reality that other people's live may genuinely be "better" than yours.
And I don't think I want that the reason be why I practice meditation, as it would amount to a kind of escape from my reality. 

I think many of my angsts are honestly based on ignorance and ego. 
I think the conclusion is that I just need to learn more about this. 
So far, I've found [Nick Cammaratta](https://x.com/nickcammarata?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)'s writing to be extremely relevant since he's an advanced meditator that knows his way around the ultra-ambitious San Francisco tech crowd.

I also want to better understand my relationship with serenity and ambition.

On the one hand, I find myself uniquely positioned to do some really cool things from a place a love (build technologies that make people's lives better). 
On the other hand, I also find myself having to notice when I'm doing things out of identity, rather than genuine curiosity. 
That is, am I doing this because I want to fulfill the role of the "high-potential, smart person", or from a place of genuine curiosity. 
I find that the latter motivation is puts a lot of negative pressure on myself, with very margin for error before careening into psychoological self-flagelation
A conversation with Sasha Chapin's a couple months ago was very helpful in cluing me into the deep aversion I had for failure: I really did not want to fail in any way whatsoever, but that either led me to being overly conservative, or overly harsh whenever I did do something wrong.  
And upon further investigation I began noticing how much of this struggle was rooted in a deep, deep pride.

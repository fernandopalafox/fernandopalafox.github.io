Quiet as the sun  
I don’t know where I’ve begun  

My feet are on the path  
But the eye that sees all was not designed to speak  

Youth of ancient descent  
Ancestor of the future  
A paradoxical life of bounded freedom  
Mind outside time, yet bound by space  
A hundred thousand screams of silence  

Whose voice do I trust and where is my own  
Window shopping for something to believe in  
I thought there would be something in my nothing  

I found all form created by thoughts  
and they must be the cause of the knots  
In my stomach, my heart, and my head  

I feel but I don’t touch  
Tour of my soul  
This everlasting ride   
of Ceaseless becoming  

Colors of heat splitting from the sun   
keep alive the spaces they dance upon  

I don’t know much about anything really  
But I do know how life makes me feel  
Love is all you need, silly

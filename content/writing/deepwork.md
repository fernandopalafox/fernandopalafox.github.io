draft: true

- Why 
  - Examples
    - Carl Jung, one of the most influenctial thinkers of the 20th century
    - Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration
    that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve
    your skill, and are hard to replicate.
    - Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
    - Woody Allen
    - Christopher Nollan
    - Bill Gates
    - Neal Stephenson
  - Our job, as graduate students depends on deep, uninterrupted periods of work. 
  - True value comes from depth, and depth will not be found in series of 5-minute bursts of stress-fueled rwork
  - Examples
    - 
- What will you be able to do afterwards? 
- Intent: to convince that it's something you should do

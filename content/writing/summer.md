August 2024

The plan was simple: meditate, lift, and code. 
This summer I left Austin for Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
I was offered an internship at Honda Research Institute working on self-driving cars, so I bought a car and drove to Michigan in late May.
All I brought was my laptop, a pile of books, and some clothes. 
Here's a bit of what I learned, and my thoughts on why every guy in their 20's should disapear for a bit and spend some time by themselves.

This is a collection of thoughts in no particular order, so just skip around to what sounds most interesting. 

### The Plan

My 2024 has been an incredible process of finding what I'm interested in when I'm not thinking of who I *should* be. 
This has involved taking a break from cycling (wow, I never thought I'd say this) and leaving most social media, certain social circles, and a relationship. 
I've found myself drawn towards running, lifting, coding, and meditation.
So, when I got the offer for the internship in April, I realized I had the perfect opportunity to take this process even further. 
I absolutely adore people, and when I'm in Austin I'm normally pretty booked with social commitments. 
I love my friends. 
However, this time the goal was simple: meditate, exercise, and code. 
Nothing else.
And that's exactly what I did. 

Some numbers to get started
- 3 months 
- ~60 hours of meditation
- 60 days in the office
- ~40 runs
- ~30 hours of meditation talks
- ~30 lifts
- 10 books
- Many thousands of lines of code

Here's what I learned 

One of the first things I became aware of is how much built up tensions I had. 
Since February, I've had some some pretty serious neck tightness that I was finally able to release over the course of the summer by consistently noting how I held my body. 
I was suprised at how much tension I have in my face, particularly in my forehead and around the eyes. 
Consistenyl releasing this does wonders to your mood. 
Obviously sitting for meditation is incredibly useful for this, but it's not the only way, literally just taking a couple of seconds to note how you're holding your body does wonders to the body.  

If I've learned anything from a bunch of meditation, therapy, and self-help books is that the solution to most emotional knots is facing any and all accompanying emotions. 
It's amazing how much of my behavior came from a place of avoidance. 
There's simple ones, like using your phone all the time. 
I found avoidance even in some unexpected places: exercise, a close relationship, sex, and even meditation all be used to avoid unmforotable emotions!

Emotionally, I found a lot of sadness and anger.  
So, with a sense of adventure and curiosity, I set out to face these uncomfortable feelings
I just accepted what I found, and it was mostly characterized by two emotions that kinda felt stuck: anger and sadness. 
Anger typically manifested itself when meditating both via tons of angry thoughts, physical tension, elevated heartrate, and even profuse sweating. 
The angry thoughts are sometimes directed towards others, but mostly towards myself. 
"Be better!" "Work harder!" "How are you so dumb!" "What you just did was so cringe!" "Feeling like this is only slowing you down, suck it up, buttercup!"
Much of this summer was learning how to skillfully let anger flow, noting when pride made me hold on to it, 
I also spent a bunch of time being being more gentle, both with myself and with others, 

On the other hand, sadness typically manifests itself in the mornings and evenings. 
There's something special about a slow, quiet morning before the sun is up, or a cool night where the only sound is the soft rustling of leaves.
These are [thin spaces](https://pres-outlook.org/2021/02/thin-places-here-there-or-everywhere/#:~:text=Iona%20is%20known%20as%20a,often%20transformed%20by%20the%20experience.) that consistently water the seeds of any unexpressed sadness. 
In the past, my first reaction to this would've been to immediately drown out any uncomfortable feelings with a podcast, some doomscrolling, or even a guided meditation (yes, you can use meditation to avoid feelings, too)
This time however, I decided to welcome these feelings, no matter how uncomfortable they were. 
I found that a great way of doing this was to lay on the floor and look at the ceiling. 
A bit of ["Do Nothing" meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA).
The closest way of describing how this felt is melting into the enormity of life[^1].
And it brought me some immensely cathartic experiences.

In one of these sits I had a moment of immense emotional release where I learned that it's possible to forgive and love even those that have hurt you the most.[^2]
I felt a stream of energy which I can best describe as a moment where I channeled some kind of divine forgiveness. 
I was not under control, and I've never felt anything quite like this, and once it was over it left me in a warm and fuzzy state of understanding and love. 
I wrote a lot about this moment. 
Maybe one day I'll share it on here.

Part of the process of [self-authorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authorship) involved making friends with my fear of failure. 
A common theme the past year has been making an effort to leave my local talent bubble and expose myself to the best and most talented people out there. 
This led to a ton of heartbreak as I found out just how much of my identity and self-worth was wrapped up in feeling smart. 
Once I got past that though, I found myself doing some really interesting but hard things where failing was an inevitable part of the process. 
Who would've thought a PhD in robotics and AI is hard? 
Or that self-driving cars don't work on the first try?
And that's where I learned just how much I hate failing.
So I focused on this and I began to re-frame failure as an error-correction mechanism.
David Deutsch said it best: errors are inevitable. 
So, don't spend all your energy trying to be perfect, instead, maximize your error correction![^3]
Increase speed of iteration. 
Fail fast!
I began to notice how much procrastination, even with relatively simple tasks, was because of the following simple idea: there's probably a better way of solving what I'm trying to do and I don't know about it yet. 
So I might as well not try. 

Speaking of trying new things, I find myself at an interesting point in my life: I'm single AND I feel pretty comfortable with who I am.
Unfortunately, these two have never happened at the same time before.
So, I've started shooting my shot, and approaching women I would've never had the confidence to talk to before. 
At the start I found it hilarious how my body would go into full fight-or-flight mode when talking to a beautiful girl.
Sweaty palms, heart pounding, and shaking hands. 
All because I was talking to an attractive human being. 
Lots to write about here, but it's definitely been an interesting development in my life.

Mostly, I've gained a whole new level of appreciation and respect for women and femininity. 
As a man, I'm majorly rewarded by displaying confidence and competence.
This is not a complaint, I've become very attuned with masculinity and my desire to develop to my fullest extent. 
It just feels part of who I am. 
But life has lots of ups and down, and as scary as it sounds, it's nice to feel safe in a space of vulnerability. 
I've been hurt in this space before, and it's definitely taken time to open up again. 
However, I was fortunate enough to meet a particularly beautiful girl that changed how I viewed all this.
She showed me how it's ok to drop the mask and be vulnerable. 
Safely. 
It was in these moments of tenderness, in the warm, and loving embrace of someone that cares for you, that masculine and the feminine energy fall into place like two pieces of a puzzle. 
When you look into the eyes of a woman you love, you see the entire universe, and your purpose becomes so clear. 
The yin and the yang.
It's beautiful. 
It's powerful.
It's baked into our DNA.
Thank you, R.

Apart from the tender moments, the drive a women will give you is nothing short of a stimulant. 
Nothing will wake you up, sit you back straighter, and give you confidence like knowing your hard work is part of a mission to build something with a woman you love.
Naval Ravikant has this old tweet that I think about a lot:
> ["Men are the means; women are the motive."](https://x.com/naval/status/10456426317?lang=en)
God damn. 
I've never felt a fire in my soul to build something big and to spread my wings when I know it's for the purpose of building a life with a woman I love.
Now I understand why the Greeks fucked up Troy over Helen. 

Beyond the romantic aspect of this, my relationship to women has changed. 
Appreciation for my mom and the women in my life
Their wisdom

Here's a picture of all the books I've ready.
The books I read and how my relationship to understanding has changed.

## Finale and why you should try this too

It's in this silence that you'll get a glimpse of who you are and what you're meant to be. 
By no means have I figure it out.
And I still think that we're social animals, and our spiritual development does not happen in isolation. 
But a period of solitude is definitely part of it. 
Personally, I think I'm past the self-help part of my journey. 
It's been good, but I want to continue digging into technical stuff. 
I've never been as fascinated and/or excited about my work as recently. 

Thank you for reading

[^2] Even cooler is the fact that you can do all this AND still have healthy boundaries with them.
[^3] If this sounds interesting, I highly suggest reading Deutsch's The Beggining of Infinity. Shameless plug to my notes [here](infinity.md). I also like the OODA loop.

August 2024

The plan was simple: meditate, lift, and code. 
This summer, I was hired as an intern at Honda Research Institute to work on self-driving cars. 
When I found out the job was in Ann Arbor, Michigan I knew it was the perfect opportunity to go monk-mode for a couple months and focus on my interests.
I love my life in Austin, but you don't always get the change to temporarily move to a quiet place, with zero distractions, great weather, and an interesting job.
Here is a bit of what I learned, and my thoughts on why dissapearing for a bit can be so valuable -- particularly if you're like me: in your 20s and trying to figure it all out. 

2024 has been the wildest year of my life so far and and a fun exercise in sharpnening my priorities are and finding what I'm interested in when I'm not thinking of who I *should* be. 
This has involved taking a break from cycling (wow, I never thought I'd say this), leaving most social media, certain social circles, and a even relationship. 
Instead, I've found myself drawn towards coding, running, lifting, and meditation.
(Find a better transition here)

Nothing has affected how I relate to the world as much as meditation.
I started in 2020, but my practice was inconsistent until last year. 
As I settled into a routine of 30-60' of sitting a day (I wrote a bit about it HERE), one of the first things I found was a ton of physical tension.
My face, shoulders, and neck were a compacted mess of tension that released as I noted it.
Some of it was "easy": merely noting how I held my face immediately relaxed it.
Some took more time, like the knot on my neck which slowly relaxed over 10-20 hours of meditation. 

I also spent a bunch of time noting how I typically relate to (and sometimes avoid) uncomfortable emotions like anger and sadness.  
If I've learned anything from meditation, therapy, and a self-help books is that most emotional knots unravel when you face any accompanying emotions. 
Emotions typically show up for a reason, and not expressing skillfully seems to give them more energy and stagnate them.
So, [I made my mind my friend](https://www.body-dynamics.net/articles/anonymous-samurai-poem.html) and used the uncomfortable emotions as the focus, rather than the reason, of my meditation.
I found that many (most) "bad" habits such as excessive phone use and anxious eating typically came from a place of avoidance.
Those made sense and not entirely unexpected, but I was surprised to find that I also used some "healthy" habits, like exercise, calls with friends, and even meditation, as a way of avoiding hard emotions. 
Surprisingly, I also found avoidance in habits I typically identified as healthy: even exercise, sex, close relationships, and even meditation. 

When digging deep into t, I found a lot of sadness and anger.  
So, with a sense of adventure and curiosity, I set out to face these uncomfortable feelings
I just accepted what I found, and it was mostly characterized by two emotions that kinda felt stuck: anger and sadness. 
Anger typically manifested itself when meditating via tons of angry thoughts, physical tension, elevated heartrate, and even profuse sweating. 
The angry thoughts were sometimes directed towards others, but mostly towards myself. 
"Be better!" "Work harder!" "How are you so dumb!" "What you just did was so cringe!" "Feeling like this is only slowing you down, suck it up, buttercup!"
Much of this summer was learning how to skillfully let anger flow, noting when pride made me hold on to it, and slowly releasing it.
I also spent a bunch of time learning how to be more gentle, both with myself and with others, 

On the other hand, sadness typically manifests itself in the mornings and evenings. 
There's something special about a slow, quiet morning before the sun is up, or a cool night where the only sound is the soft rustling of leaves.
These are [thin spaces](https://pres-outlook.org/2021/02/thin-places-here-there-or-everywhere/#:~:text=Iona%20is%20known%20as%20a,often%20transformed%20by%20the%20experience.) that consistently water the seeds of any unexpressed sadness. 
In the past, my first reaction to this would've been to immediately drown out any uncomfortable feelings with a podcast, some doomscrolling, or even a guided meditation (yes, you can use meditation to avoid feelings, too)
This time however, I decided to welcome these feelings, no matter how uncomfortable they were. 
I found that a great way of doing this was to lay on the floor and look at the ceiling. 
A bit of ["Do Nothing" meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA).
The closest way of describing how this felt is melting into the enormity of life[^1].
And it brought me some immensely cathartic experiences.

In one of these sits I had a moment of immense emotional release where I learned that it's possible to forgive and love even those that have hurt you the most.[^2]
I felt a stream of energy which I can best describe as a moment where I channeled some kind of divine forgiveness. 
I've never felt anything quite like this, and once it was over it left me in a warm and fuzzy state of understanding and love. 
I wrote a lot about this moment and it was very cathartic. 
Maybe one day I'll share it on here.

I also spent quite a bit of time making friends with my fear of failure. 
A common theme the past year has been making an effort to leave my local talent bubble and expose myself to the best and most talented people out there. 
This led to a ton of heartbreak as I found out just how much of my identity and self-worth was wrapped up around feeling like the smartest person in the room. 
Once I got past that though, I found myself doing some really interesting but hard things where failing at some point was inevitable
Who would've thought a PhD in robotics and AI is hard? 
Or that self-driving cars don't work on the first try?
And that's where I learned just how much I hate failing and began doing everything to avoid it at all costs. 
Unfortunately, as David Deutsch writes: errors are inevitable. 
So I focused on this and re-framed failure as an error-correction mechanism.
So, don't spend all your energy trying to be perfect, instead, maximize your error correction![^3]
Increase speed of iteration. 
Fail fast!

I find myself at an interesting point in life: I'm single AND I feel pretty comfortable with who I am.
Unfortunately, these two have never happened at the same time before.
So, I've started shooting my shot, and approaching women I would've never had the confidence to talk to before, making friends with the idea of rejection.
At the start I found it hilarious how my body would go into full fight-or-flight mode when talking to a beautiful girl.
Sweaty palms, heart pounding, and shaking hands. 
All because I was talking to an attractive human being. 
Lots to write about here, but it's definitely been an interesting development in my life.

Mostly, I've gained a whole new level of appreciation and respect for women and femininity. 
As a guy, I'm majorly rewarded by displaying confidence and competence.
And I actually enjoy that. 
As I've become more attuned with my masculinity, I find great joy in finding confidence in myself and gettings good at skills I care about. 
It just feels part of who I am. 
But life has lots of ups and down, and once in a while, it's nice to feel safe enough to be vulnerable with my feelings, hopes, and dreams.  
I've been hurt in this space before, and it's definitely taken time to open up again. 
Fortunatnely, I've been fortunate enough to meet a particularly beautiful girl that changed how I viewed all this.
She showed me how it's ok to drop the mask and be vulnerable. 
In these moments of tenderness, in the warm, and loving embrace of someone that cares for you, I felt how masculine and the feminine energy perfectly fall into place like two pieces of a puzzle. 
The yin and the yang.
It's beautiful. 
It's powerful.
It's baked into our DNA.
Thank you, R.

Apart from the tender moments, the drive a women will give you is nothing short of a stimulant. 
Nothing will wake you up, make you stand straighter, and give you confidence like knowing your hard work is part of a mission to build something with a woman you love.
Naval Ravikant has this old tweet that I think about a lot:
> ["Men are the means; women are the motive."](https://x.com/naval/status/10456426317?lang=en)
God damn. 
Now I understand why the Greeks fucked up Troy over Helen. 

I've found a a whole new level of appreciation and respect for women and femininity, beyond the romantic aspect.
I've worked through some old traumas and have opened myself up to the wisdom of the women in my life. 
Principally, it's been my mother. 
I'm still very much confused about what goes on inside a woman's brain.
But their tenderness and feminine wisdom is so valuable.

## Finale and why you should try this too

Here are some numbers to describe the summer. 

Some numbers to get started
- 3 months 
- ~60 hours of meditation
- 60 days in the office
- ~40 runs
- ~30 hours of meditation talks
- ~30 lifts
- 10 books
- Many thousands of lines of code

It was joyful, it was lonely, it was beautiful, it was scary. 

It's in this silence that you'll get a glimpse of who you are and what you're meant to be. 
By no means have I figure it out.
And I still think that we're social animals, and our spiritual development does not happen in isolation. 
But a period of solitude is definitely part of it. 
Personally, I think I'm past the self-help part of my journey. 
It's been good, but I want to continue digging into technical stuff. 
I've never been as fascinated and/or excited about my work as recently. 

Thank you for reading

[^2] Even cooler is the fact that you can do all this AND still have healthy boundaries with them.
[^3] If this sounds interesting, I highly suggest reading Deutsch's The Beggining of Infinity. Shameless plug to my notes [here](infinity.md). I also like the OODA loop.

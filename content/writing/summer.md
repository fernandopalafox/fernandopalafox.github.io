August 2024

The plan was simple: meditate, lift, and code. 
This summer, I was hired as an intern at Honda Research Institute to work on self-driving cars. 
When I found out the job was in Ann Arbor, Michigan I knew it was the perfect opportunity to go monk-mode for a couple months and focus on my interests.
I love my life in Austin, but you don't always get the change to temporarily move to a quiet place, with zero distractions, great weather, and an interesting job.
Here is a bit of what I learned, and my thoughts on why dissapearing for a bit can be so valuable -- particularly if you're like me: in your 20s and trying to figure it all out. 

2024 has been the wildest year of my life so far and and a fun exercise in sharpnening my priorities are and finding what I'm interested in when I'm not thinking of who I *should* be. 
This has involved taking a break from cycling (wow, I never thought I'd say this), leaving most social media, certain social circles, and a even relationship. 
Instead, I've found myself drawn towards coding, running, lifting, and meditation.
(Find a better transition here)

Nothing has affected how I relate to the world as much as meditation.
I started in 2020, but my practice was inconsistent until last year. 
As I settled into a routine of 30-60' of sitting a day (I wrote a bit about it HERE), one of the first things I found was a ton of physical tension.
My face, shoulders, and neck were a compacted mess of tension that released as I noted it.
Some of it was "easy": merely noting how I held my face immediately relaxed it.
Some took more time, like the knot on my neck which slowly relaxed over 10-20 hours of meditation. 

I also spent a bunch of time noting how I typically relate to (and sometimes avoid) uncomfortable emotions like anger and sadness.  
If I've learned anything from meditation, therapy, and a self-help books is that most emotional knots unravel when you face any accompanying emotions. 
Emotions show up for a reason, and not expressing them skillfully seems to give them more energy and stagnate them.
So, [I made my mind my friend](https://www.body-dynamics.net/articles/anonymous-samurai-poem.html) and used the emotions as the focus, rather than the reason, of my meditation.
I found that most of my "bad" habits like excessive scrolling on my phone or anxious eating came from a place of avoidance.
That made sense: they're easy to access hits of stimulation that provide immediate distraction from whatever is going on. 
But what I found very surprising was that even some healthy activities, like exercise, sex, close relationships, and even meditation, could also be used to avoid hard emotions. 
There's definitely an optimal point to be struck: I'm not trying to live in perpetual self-flagellation because "I need to face hard things!", but spending some time noting when the balance went towards avoidance was really good. 
It got rid of many bad habits, and allowed me to be more present for the healthy ones. 

Another finding when meditating was that I had lots of stuck anger and sadness. 
Anger typically showed up via tons of angry thoughts, physical tension, elevated heartrate, and even profuse sweating. 
The angry thoughts were sometimes directed towards others, but mostly towards myself. 
"Be better!" "Work harder!" "How are you so dumb!" "What you just did was so cringe!" "Feeling like this is only slowing you down, suck it up, buttercup!"
Much of this summer was learning how to skillfully let the anger flow, noting when pride made me hold on to it, and gently letting it go.
I also spent a bunch of time learning how to be more gentle, both with myself and with others, 

On the other hand, sadness typically manifests itself in the mornings and evenings.
There's something special about a slow, quiet morning before the sun is up, or a cool night where the only sound is the soft rustling of leaves.
These are [thin spaces](https://pres-outlook.org/2021/02/thin-places-here-there-or-everywhere/#:~:text=Iona%20is%20known%20as%20a,often%20transformed%20by%20the%20experience.) that consistently allow any unexpressed sadness to blossom.
In the past, my first reaction to sadness would've been to immediately drown it with a podcast, some doomscrolling, or even meditation.
This time however, I decided to welcome these feelings, no matter how uncomfortable they were.
This was made much easier by some wonderful guided meditations like Tara Brach's [RAIN](https://www.tarabrach.com/rain/), Jayasāra's [loving-kindness meditation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWzYrEdlV4O5o5GKepTGPx7tcow3aR-Jj), or Jitindriyā's [*Meeting Things As They Are*](https://vivekahermitage.com/embodying-awareness-metta/).
Another great one was to lay on the floor, setting a 30' timer, and looking at the ceiling - a bit of Shinzen Young's ["Do Nothing" meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA).
Some of these moments of stillness made me feel in a way that is best described as melting into the enormity of life[^2].
And it brought me some immensely cathartic experiences.

For example, on a quiet June night I had an immense emotional release where I learned it's possible to forgive and love even those that have hurt you the most.[^3]
For a couple minutes, I felt like I was channelling some kind of divine forgiveness that felt 100% out of my control.
It was a bit scary, but it also left me in left me in a warm and fuzzy state of understanding and love that I can still feel. 
I wrote a lot about this moment, maybe one day I'll share it on here.

I also spent quite a bit of time making friends with my fear of failure. 
A common theme the past year has been making an effort to leave my local bubble and exposing myself to the best and most talented people out there. 
This initially led to a ton of heartbreak as I found out just how much of my identity and self-worth was wrapped up around feeling like the smartest person in the room. 
Once I got past that though, I found myself doing some really interesting but hard things where failing at some point was inevitable.
Who would've thought a PhD in robotics and AI is hard? 
Or that self-driving cars don't work on the first try?
And that's where I learned just how much I hate failing and how much struggle and energy I spent avoiding it at all costs.
Unfortunately, as David Deutsch writes in the Beginning of Infinity (one of my favorite books): errors are inevitable. 
The trick is not to spend all your energy trying to be perfect, and instead, maximizing your error correction![^3]
So I focused on this and re-framed failure as an error-correction mechanism. 
I made friends with it, and started training myself to enjoy it, seeing at as a sign that I was trying interesting things AND I was also learning from it.

I find myself at an interesting point in life: I'm single AND I feel pretty comfortable with who I am.
Unfortunately, these two have never happened at the same time before.
So, I've started shooting my shot, and approaching women I would've never had the confidence to talk to before, curious about and even welcoming rejection.
At the start I found it hilarious how my body would go into full fight-or-flight mode when talking to a beautiful girl.
Sweaty palms, heart pounding, and shaking hands, all because I was talking to an attractive human being. 
Lots to write about here, but it's definitely been a change of pace.

Mostly, I've gained a whole new level of appreciation and respect for women and femininity. 
As a guy, I'm majorly rewarded by displaying confidence and competence.
And I actually enjoy that. 
As I've become more attuned with my masculinity, I find great joy in finding confidence in myself and getting good at skills I care about. 
But life has lots of ups and down, and once in a while, it's nice to feel safe enough to be vulnerable about my feelings, concerns, hopes, and dreams.  
I've been hurt when opening up before, and it's definitely taken time to open up again, but every time I do it, it's always worth it. 
I recently met a particularly beautiful girl that changed a lot about about how I review relationships.
She showed me how it's ok to drop the mask and be vulnerable. 
In these moments of tenderness, in the warm, and loving embrace of someone that cares for you, I felt how masculine and the feminine energy perfectly fall into place like two pieces of a puzzle. 
The yin and the yang.
It's beautiful. 
It's powerful.
It's baked into our DNA.
Thank you, R.

Tender moments are nice, but the drive a women will give you is nothing short of a weapons-grade stimulant. 
Nothing will wake you up, make you stand straighter, and give you confidence like knowing your hard work is part of a mission to build something with a woman you love.
Naval Ravikant has this old tweet that I think about a lot:
> ["Men are the means; women are the motive."](https://x.com/naval/status/10456426317?lang=en)
God damn. 
Now I understand why the Greeks fucked up Troy over Helen.

Separate from any romance, I've also opened myself up to the wisdom of the women in my life, like my mom.  
I'm still very confused about what goes on inside a woman's brain, but their tenderness and feminine wisdom is so valuable and beautiful. 

## Finale and why you should try this too

Here are some numbers to describe the summer. 

Some numbers to get started
- 3 months 
- 60 days in the office
- ~60 hours of meditation
- ~40 runs
- ~30 hours of meditation talks
- ~30 lifts
- 10 books
- Many thousands of lines of code

It was joyful, it was lonely, it was sad, it was beautiful, it was scary, it was exciting. 

It's in this silence that you'll get a glimpse of who you are and what you're meant to be. 
I haven't figured it out, but I have enough to get by with with a sense of confidence and calm that I've never felt bfeore.
Now I still think that we're social animals, and our spiritual development does not happen in isolation. 
But a period of solitude is definitely part of growing up.
Try it out, and report back, I promise it's worth it.

What's next? 
I think I'm gonna give the self-help a break for now.
You'll also notice that I didn't write much about technical stuff. 
I learned a lot in that respect, and much of it is still cooking, but I'll release that work when it's ready and hopefully it will speak for itself.
It's been extremely formative (and very necessary), but I want to continue digging into technical stuff. 
I've never been as fascinated and/or excited about my work as recently and I'm gonna dig into that next.

Thank you for reading.

[^1]: Jayasāra's guided meditations are phenomenal. One of my favorites is [Tilopa's Six Words of Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1ov_dVJ0s&list=PLWzYrEdlV4O5o5GKepTGPx7tcow3aR-Jj&index=4). So good.
[^2]: There's a future post describing exactly what I experienced in these sessions of staring, but I don't have language to describe this, quite yet. 
[^3]: Even cooler is the fact that you can do all this AND still have healthy boundaries with them.
[^4]: If this sounds interesting, I highly suggest reading Deutsch's The Beggining of Infinity. Shameless plug to my notes [here](infinity.md). I also like the OODA loop.

August 2024

The plan was simple: meditate, lift, and code. 
This summer I left Austin for Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
I was offered an internship at Honda Research Institute working on self-driving cars, so I bought a car and drove to Michigan in late May.
All I brought was my laptop, a pile of books, and some clothes. 
Here's a bit of what I learned, and my thoughts on why every guy in their 20's should disapear for a bit and spend some time by themselves.

This is a collection of thoughts in no particular order, so just skip around to what sounds most interesting. 

### The Plan

My 2024 has been an incredible process of finding what I'm interested in when I'm not thinking of who I *should* be. 
This has involved taking a break from cycling (wow, I never thought I'd say this) and leaving most social media, certain social circles, and a relationship. 
I've found myself drawn towards running, lifting, coding, and meditation.
So, when I got the offer for the internship in April, I realized I had the perfect opportunity to take this process even further. 
I absolutely adore people, and when I'm in Austin I'm normally pretty booked with social commitments. 
I love my friends. 
However, this time the goal was simple: meditate, exercise, and code. 
Nothing else.
And that's exactly what I did. 

Some numbers to get started
- 3 months 
- ~60 hours of meditation
- 60 days in the office
- ~40 runs
- ~30 hours of meditation talks
- ~30 lifts
- 10 books
- Many thousands of lines of code

Here's what I learned 

One of the first things I became aware of is how much built up tensions I had. 
Since February, I've had some some pretty serious neck tightness that I was finally able to release over the course of the summer by consistently noting how I held my body. 
I was suprised at how much tension I have in my face, particularly in my forehead and around the eyes. 
Consistenyl releasing this does wonders to your mood. 
Obviously sitting for meditation is incredibly useful for this, but it's not the only way, literally just taking a couple of seconds to note how you're holding your body does wonders to the body.  

If I've learned anything from a bunch of meditation, therapy, and self-help books is that the solution to most emotional knots is facing any and all accompanying emotions. 
It's amazing how much of my behavior came from a place of avoidance. 
There's simple ones, like using your phone all the time. 
I found avoidance even in some unexpected places: exercise, a close relationship, sex, and even meditation all be used to avoid unmforotable emotions!

Emotionally, I found a lot of sadness and anger.  
So, with a sense of adventure and curiosity, I set out to face these uncomfortable feelings
I just accepted what I found, and it was mostly characterized by two emotions that kinda felt stuck: anger and sadness. 
Anger typically manifested itself when meditating both via tons of angry thoughts, physical tension, elevated heartrate, and even profuse sweating. 
The angry thoughts are sometimes directed towards others, but mostly towards myself. 
"Be better!" "Work harder!" "How are you so dumb!" "What you just did was so cringe!" "Feeling like this is only slowing you down, suck it up, buttercup!"
Much of this summer was learning how to skillfully let anger flow, noting when pride made me hold on to it, 
I also spent a bunch of time being being more gentle, both with myself and with others, 

On the other hand, sadness typically manifests itself in the mornings and evenings. 
There's something special about a slow, quiet morning before the sun is up, or a cool night where the only sound is the soft rustling of leaves.
These are [thin spaces](https://pres-outlook.org/2021/02/thin-places-here-there-or-everywhere/#:~:text=Iona%20is%20known%20as%20a,often%20transformed%20by%20the%20experience.) that consistently water the seeds of any unexpressed sadness. 
In the past, my first reaction to this would've been to immediately drown out any uncomfortable feelings with a podcast, some doomscrolling, or even a guided meditation (yes, you can use meditation to avoid feelings, too)
This time however, I decided to welcome these feelings, no matter how uncomfortable they were. 
I found that a great way of doing this was to lay on the floor and look at the ceiling. 
A bit of ["Do Nothing" meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6cdIaUZCA).
The closest way of describing how this felt is melting into the enormity of life[^1].
And it brought me some immensely cathartic experiences.

In one of these sits I had a moment of immense emotional release where I learned that it's possible to forgive and love even those that have hurt you the most.[^2]
I felt a stream of energy which I can best describe as a moment where I channeled some kind of divine forgiveness. 
I was not under control, and I've never felt anything quite like this, and once it was over it left me in a warm and fuzzy state of understanding and love. 
I wrote a lot about this moment. 
Maybe one day I'll share it on here.

Part of the process of [self-authorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authorship) involved making friends with my fear of failure. 
A common theme the past year has been making an effort to leave my local talent bubble and expose myself to the best and most talented people out there. 
This led to a ton of heartbreak as I found out just how much of my identity and self-worth was wrapped up in feeling smart. 
Once I got past that though, I found myself doing some really interesting but hard things where failing was an inevitable part of the process. 
Who would've thought a PhD in robotics and AI is hard? 
Or that self-driving cars don't work on the first try?
And that's where I learned just how much I hate failing.
So I focused on this and I began to re-frame failure as an error-correction mechanism.
David Deutsch said it best: errors are inevitable. 
So, don't spend all your energy trying to be perfect, instead, maximize your error correction![^3]
Increase speed of iteration. 
Fail fast!
I began to notice how much procrastination, even with relatively simple tasks, was because of the following simple idea: there's probably a better way of solving what I'm trying to do and I don't know about it yet. 
So I might as well not try. 

Speaking of failure, let's talk about girls! 
I find myself at an interesting point in my life. 
Previously, being single and also feeling good about myself were mutually exclusive, and I had never felt both at the same time. 
So I've started shooting my shot and started talking to some of the most women I've ever met. 

The role of femininiity and masculinty
And I've been so fortunate to meet some amazing women. 
I could write poems about the completeness I've felt when interacting with a beautiful girl
And the conclusion is that 

Beyond romance
Beyond the romantic aspect of this, my relationship to women has changed. 
Appreciation for my mom and the women in my life
Their wisdom
Changing what I'm optimizing for. 
I've learned to appreciate just how special they are

### Feminine beauty
Talking to beautiful girls. 
This one was particularly funny: I found it hilarious how my body would go into full fight-or-flight mode when going up to a pretty girl. 
Sweaty palms, heart pounding, and shaking hands (and legs!). 
All because I was talking to an attractive human being. 
Lol. 
This one was very fun. 
Turns out pretty girls are also humans. 
Lots to write about this, but it's also the first time in my life where I find myself single AND also really feeling myself. 
Felt almost like a second puberty.
Hard to describe it. 
Some inklings of wanting to settle down too and definitely optimizing for different values. 
Midwest has definitely made me appreciate this

Some wildly cathartic experiences. 
It felt like I was shedding so many layers. 
Highly spiritual 
The feeling of pure experience, becoming. 
Choosing what mask to put on 


# Technical stuff


[^1] There's a future post describing exactly what I experienced in these sessions of staring, but I don't have language to describe this, quite yet. 
[^2] Even cooler is the fact that you can do all this AND still have healthy boundaries with them.
[^3] If this sounds interesting, I highly suggest reading Deutsch's The Beggining of Infinity. Shameless plug to my notes [here](infinity.md). I also like the OODA loop.

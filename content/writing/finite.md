Here's something that's true: most of the stuff you'd like to do, you'll never get to do.
Everyone can understand this: days only have 24 hours and life moves faster than we'd like.
But I'm not sure people actually do. 
Most people live in two ways: 
1. They just don't think about this?  
2. They keep this expectation in the back of their brain that one day, if only they can be more efficient, they'll finally finish the to-do list, that bucket list. 
I was part of the second group of people, always in search of more efficiency, better time-management, perfectly blocked out calendars. 
In a constant state of denial that all of these dreams weren't gonna happen. 
We all have versions of this: for me it's been the books I didn't read, the essays I didn't write, the friends I didn't hangout with, the trips I didn't take, the podcasts I didn't listen, the papers I didn't study, the weekend hacks I didn't make, the clubs I didn't start, the beautiful girls I didn't approach, the chances I didn't take.  
And this list only changes in one direction: it gets bigger. 

I used to cope by convincing myself that whatever I missed probably wasn't as good as I imagined it would be. 
Aka, the sour grapes approach.
In some cases, this was true. 
The mind is pretty good at building movies of what could have been, conveniently forgetting all the bad parts. 
Unfortunately, in many cases, what you miss out is *exactly* as good as you imagined it to be. 
In fact, it's sometimes even *better*. 
That trip you missed was every bit as exciting and inspiring as you imagined it. 
And it's gone.
You missed it. 
And you know what?
The same thing will happen with, literally, 99.9% of the things in your life.

Accepting this was mostly a matter of learning to let go. 
100s of times during the day I learned not to cling to any of the cool ideas, places, and people I could've spent time on. 
It meant becoming acquainted with my limitations, the fact that as much as I would like it to be the case, I'll never be as efficient as I want to be. 
That a bunch of the challenges I try will sadly never hit the perfect standards I have in my head. 
To practice the microgriefs of everything that could've been.    

What does this mean for how one lives life? 
It means taking the complete opposite of the sour grapes approach: instead of convincing yourself that what you didn't do was probably not that fun anyways, go in the complete opposite direction and accept that it was probably was. 
And then notice how much meaning this gives to any activity *do* choose to do.
Out of the literal infinity of beautiful things you could've chosen to do, this is the one you're doing. 
So you might as well go all in on it and enjoy it.

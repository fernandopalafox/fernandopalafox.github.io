Here's something that's true: most of the stuff you'd like to do, you'll never get to do.
Everyone can understand this: days only have 24 hours and life is honestly pretty short.
Everyone understands this sentence, but I'm not sure everyone gets it. 
Most people either never think or learn of this truth or they have a secret little belief that, if only they're more efficient, they'll finally finish cross-out every item in their to-do list, that bucket list. 
That they'll finally get "there", given enough time, efficiency, time-management systems, or perfectly blocked out calendars. 
In a constant state of denial that all of these dreams weren't gonna happen. 
In a state of denial of the mounting evidence in the complete opposite direction: all the books I didn't read, the essays I didn't write, the friends I didn't hangout with, the trips I didn't take, the podcasts I didn't listen, the papers I didn't study, the beautiful girls I didn't approach, the weekend projects I never started, the chances I didn't take.  

I used to cope by convincing myself that whatever I missed wasn't as good as I imagined it would be. 
Aka, the sour grapes approach.
Sometimes this was true: the mind is pretty good at building movies of what could have been, conveniently forgetting all the bad parts. 
Unfortunately, sometimes what miss out on is exactly as good as you imagined it to be. 
In fact, sometimes it's even *better*. 
That trip you missed was every bit as exciting and inspiring as you imagined it. 
And it's gone.
You missed it. 
And you know what?
The same thing will happen with, literally, 99.9% of the things you could do with your life.

But here's something else that's true: this is actually good news. 
Finding meaning in any task, in great part (or perhaps even, in it's entirety), seems to come from the sacrifice it requires. 
For me, the meaning I find in my career comes from a recognition of the opportunities I have around me and a deep sense of gratitude and responsibility that I get to give all this a shot.
Another example is committing to a relationship.
If you do, you sacrifice a relationship with every other woman in the planet to deepen your relationship with one person.[^1]
And the responsibility, and the resulting meaning, only grows deeper in marriage.  

Out of the infinity of beautiful things you could've chose to do, THIS is the one you're doing. 
Every task, even the mundane ones, take on a transcendent glow: I am alive, I exist, and I get to do this. 
So, am I really doing what I would want to do? 
Is this really what I want my life to be like? 
Is this what I want to see more of? 

[^1] Yes I know this may not apply if you polyamorous inclinations, but I hope you get my point.

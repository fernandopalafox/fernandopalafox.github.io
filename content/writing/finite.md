Here's something that's true: you'll never get to do most of the stuff you'd like to do.
Everyone can understand this truth: days only have 24 hours, weeks 7 days, and life is honestly pretty short.
But only until recently did I really begin to act in a way that reflected this understanding.
I used to have this secret little idea that, if only I was more efficient, one day I would finish crossing every item on my to-do list.
Every trip, book, or project would get done.
That given enough efficiency and time-management systems I would finally get to this heavenly state of contentment where I would rest in the satisfaction of having accomplished everything I had planned in life.
I lived constant state of denial of my limited time and capacity despite the overwhelming and ever-growing pile of evidence: the books I didn't read, the essays I didn't write, the friends I didn't hangout with, the trips I didn't take, the texts I never replied to, the podcasts I didn't listen to, the beautiful girls I didn't approach, the projects I never started, the chances I didn't take.   

I used to cope by convincing myself that whatever I missed out on was probably not as good as I imagined it to be. 
AKA, the sour grapes approach.
Sometimes this was true: the mind is very good at imagining perfect situations and conveniently forgetting all the bad parts. 
But this only got me so far, because eventually one learns that sometimes what you miss out on is exactly as good as you imagined it to be. 
In fact, sometimes it's even *better*. 
That trip you didn't go to was every bit as exciting as you imagined it. 
The book you never read was probably as inspiring and cathartic as you were told. 
And that business idea you never pursued probably would've made you a lot of money.
And they're all gone.
You missed your chance. 
And this will happen with, literally, 99.9% of the things you could do with your life.

But here's another thing that's true: this is actually good news.
It's precisely what you don't do that gives meaning to what you choose to do.
Finding meaning in any task, in great part -- or perhaps even, in it's entirety -- comes from the sacrifice it requires.
For example, if you're passionate about your career, part of its meaning may come from an understanding of what it took to get to where you are. If you're an athlete, you are probably very aware of how fucking hard it was to get fit.
Or if you're in a committed relationship it may be hard to forget all the fun puppy-love-fueled escapades you could be having.
But it's precisely when you take some responsibility, and sacrificing some things, that actions become truly meaningful.

The summary is that we have finite time and energy and there's no getting around this. 
And this is very simple to understand, but practically speaking it may not as easy to apply. 
I constantly  myself in a subtle state of indecision, of doubt: always hedging my bets in case I could decide later on. 
Not only did this indecision prevent me from reaping the benefits of any of my time investments. 

So now I try to apply a bar-bell approach: heavy on both ends, thin in the middle. 
Either I do it or I don't. 
And I don't, I try to delete it from my mental and physical landscape approach as thoroguhly as possible. 
This is also a very useful way of filtering out all the silly doom-scrolling. 
This has required learning how let go of the literal infinity of beautiful future that could've been. 
I'm 26, intensely curious, and I **love** people, so believe when I say that not a moment goes by when I'm not letting go of something.
But when I do remind myself of this something very interesting happens: every task, even the mundane ones, take on a transcendent glow. 
I exist, I am alive, and I get to do **this**.
So why wouldn't I go all the way?

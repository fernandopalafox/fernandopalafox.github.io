Here's something that's true: most of the stuff you'd like to do, you'll never get to do.
Everyone knows this: days only have 24 hours and life is kinda short.
But I'm not sure everyone FEELS this. 
Most people live in two ways: 
1. They just don't think about this?  
2. They keep this expectation in the back of their brain that one day, if only they can be more efficient, they'll finally finish the to-do list, the bucket list. 
I was part of the second group of people, always in search of more efficiency, better time-management, perfectly blocked out calendars. 
In a constant state of denial that all of these dreams weren't gonna happen. 
We all have versions of this: for me it's been the books I was going to read, the essays I would write, the friends I was going to hangout with, the trips I didn't take, the podcasts I didn't listen, the papers I didn't read, the weekend hacks I didn't make, the clubs I didn't start, the beautiful girls I didn't approach, the chances I didn't take.  
This list will only grow infinitely larger

I used to cope by taking the sour grapes approach: it's probably not as good as I made it up to be in my mind. 

What it took to accept that this was learning to let go. 
EVery single second. 
Not one moment of grasping for what could've been.

What it means for the way you live life. 
What does this mean for how one lives life? 
What does it mean that most of these beautiful things will never materialize, a taste just enough to take your breath away, but always slightly away? 
It means that what you DO choose to do takes on another meaning: out of the infinity of beautiful things you could've chosen to do, this is the one you're doing. 
Every moment, however "boring" or simple, takes on a magical moment. 
Is it really what you want to be doing?

It seems like a non-trivial part maturing has been the understanding that I'll never get to do most of the stuff I'd like to do. 
In fact, 99.99% of the things I could do, I'll never get to do. 
It's a mix of physics and time: life is short, and you won't get to do most of what you could do. 
But perhaps what's stuck the most in my mind has been the understanding that, at any given moment, any of the variety of things I could do will ever get done. 
At first I dealt with this via the sour grapes approach: it's probably not as good as it could be. 
But then you start to learn: they actually are. 
Not only that, many of these things are probably better. 
They're just as good as you think they are. 
And you're missing out. 
But it seems like this only hurts when you don't go the full way: when you sit in thinking that perhaps if you're efficient enough you'll be able to get it all done. 
Once you sit in the understanding that you wont get them done, it's suddenly ok. 
I've found it takes two things: an ability to let go of what could've been. 
Life starts to get defined not by what you do, but by what you DON'T do. ==
And here's the catch: they'
Maturing seemed to come in three stages

Hard work does not imply struggle. 
I think I use struggle as an easy distraction to prevent myself from fully dropping into the present task.
It feels like a kind of insurance against failure: if I never let myself completely fall into a task, then if I fail I can "reassure" myself it's ok because I didn't give it everything, anyways.
In a non-work setting, struggle seems to come up when I avoid some hard emotion. 
Perhaps sadness or anger. 
But avoiding them only seems to give them more energy. 

New skill that's changing my life: listening. 
Turns out you can get a surprisingly deep understanding of someone if you can just shut up and listen very closely.
Love and lust throws a wrench into all this, of course. 
Beyond the obvious personal benefits of this, your full, undivided attention is one of the best gifts you can give someone. 
Advice is overrated and often a projection. 
And even when it's actually useful, no one follows advice until they feel like they came up with it themselves. 
What people need is a good ear. 
They need to feel understood, validated, seen.
If you love someone, I can't think of a greater gift than just sitting and listening.

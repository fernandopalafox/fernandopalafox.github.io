The past month and a half has been mostly work. 
I've started a new project and decided to go all in. 
It's been good and I guess I want to write about what I've learned and how I'm doing different. 

I'm starting a new project that I'm most leading. 
Unlike previous projects, this is something I'll mostly lead myself. 

It's been an interested time!
My life is a loop of waking up, working out, meditating, working, and sleeping.

I have felt some overwhelm about current events. 
It's funny because I don't shutup about how most people should probably stop looking at the news. 
Alas, I should be better about following my own advice.
It's just hard sometimes. 
We're information-gathering creatures, it's hard not to know when to stop
And my life has also changed so much thanks to Twitter. 
I've been exposed to some amazing ideas, but balancing on that razor's edge is hard. 

I've also had some pretty cool experiences. 
I've repeatedly had these intense feelings of meaning that are hard to explain. 
My skills with words are but a poor projection of the experiences I've had, but it's spiritual as fuck and loaded with meaning.
First they started coming at night, a feeling of a connection with the sublime ([I wrote about it here](summed.md)). 
I've felt these moments when coming home from work after using my brain full throttle. 
Sitting quietly at home and dimmmed lights I'm overwhelmed by a feeling of meaning. 
A feeling of non-stop becoming, of connecting with the inneffable nature of mind, awareness, and existence. 
A warm, loving state of awareness, previously only accessible in dimly lit, quiet moments at night, but increasingly avaialable at all times. 
I feel it now. 
And it's an experience beyond anything I've ever felt before. 
Is this what people call God? 

This experience has also felt as personal as it gets. 
Whereas before I always looked for refrences on whatever I was studying, or doing. 
This experience is so complete, it doesn't require any reference.
It encompasses everything. 

It's meant getting insight into a couple things
For example, i've found t's harder and harder to stay angry, anxious, or sad.
Any bad emotions vanishes the moment I stop avoidiing them, sit and let them through. 
It's harder to take things personally too. 
Something bad happens to me?
Who is me? 
Something happened, it's uncomfortable, but who says it's bad? 
It follows that in the face of uncomfortable interactions with other people, the first thought that comes into my mind is not how they've wronged me, but what they must be going through to "wrong" me in that way. 
Wishing anyone, even the most despicable person I can think of, a hard time just does not seem to make any sense.
Two paths come into my head: 
- someone made me feel a way I didn't like, and I should change that. 
- If I let this person continue doing what they're doing, the world will be a worse place. 

On the first point. 
But I felt pain and anger! 
No. 
There was awareness of pain and anger. 
And look, now it's gone. 

On the second point: if what you're after really is to make the world a better place by changing this person, let's think about why this person did what they did. 
It would be nice if everyone was ego-less and ready to change when faced with a truth about how they're doing something wrong. 
But the truth is, most people's egos get in their way. 
And every time you address it directly, you'll remind the person of it, strengthen it. 
There may be ways of doing this, perhaps if this person really, really respects you, or you are just really fucking skilled at words. 
But I've found that, in fact, the most effective way has two steps: 
1)  to understand that the way someone is acting is probably load-bearing for them in some capacity, or else they wouldn't do it. This is especcially true when it's a habit that causes some pain for the person.  
2) Lead by example. Most people's ego gets in the way of implementing any real change, EVEN WHEN it's very obviously good for them. People are proud and silly. But you can lead them away from any notion of who they are, who they're supposed ot be, who they want to be, if you show them how better life is for you because you're doing things differently. 
I have a concrete example: as much as I shared th ebenefits of working out to my friends, no one gave a shit about it until I got jacked, groomed better, and friends saw how girls started paying attention to me differently. 
I had THREE friends start lifting bceause of that. 
And guess what, how did I start lifting? 
I saw people's benefited by it on twitter (thanks levelsio).

I tend to be pretty self-conscious of the heaviness with which I approach relationships. 
This is related 

It's reframed the heavines I feel in terms of love. Quote nietzche here. 
Effort and understanding

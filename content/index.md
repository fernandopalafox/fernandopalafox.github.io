 I am a PhD student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at UT Austin I am interested in **artificial intelligence in the context of multi-agent interactions**. Concretely, I design control strategies for multi-agent interactions so that robots can safely, and seamlessly, interact with humans in the world. My work leverages dynamic game theory, optimal control, and machine learning.  I am part of the the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) and I am advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil) .

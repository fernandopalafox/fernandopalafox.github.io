---

I am a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) at the University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil) and I work on developing novel methods to enhance robots' comprehension of their interactions with humans. My research involves expertise in the areas of multi-agent planning, controls, machine learning, and game theory.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder. During my time there, I worked on satellite navigation technologies and software-defined radios at the [RF & SatNav Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/rf-satnav/) with [Dr. Dennis Akos](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/dennis-akos). 

I am passionate about [health and longevity](health.md)

I am also an avid [ultra-endurance cyclist](https://www.strava.com/activities/8737219081) and sometimes [write about my adventures](https://theradavist.com/argentina-gravel-cycling/).

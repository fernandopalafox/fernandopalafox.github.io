title: Health and Longevity
---
I'm a big fan of excercise and undertanding how my body works. I'm also an engineer and I like measuring stuff, so I've spent a lot of time reading about health and longevity. Here's a list of what I do to stay healthy, and some of the resources I've found helpful.

# Exercise
My current focus is on strength and endurance and my weekly routine consists of 3-4 weighlifting sessions (I follow the [ATG program](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/)), and a mix of cycling and running (coached by [Brad Seng](https://www.d3multisport.com/our-coaches/brad-seng)). I try to get at least one high-intensity cardio workout a week (e.g. intervals on the run, or a hard group ride/race on the bike), and one long ride (3+ hrs). I also don't have a car, so I move on a bike most of the time, amounting to an extra 2-3 hours of low-intensity cardio a week.

Altough I grew up playing sports, I never trained for anything seriously. This changed when I moved to Boulder and I joined the [CU Triathlon Team](https://www.cutriathlon.com/). Training for a sport like triathlon requires a consistency and structure that spoke to my left-brain inclinations, and even though the getting habit flywheel moving was increadibly challenging, I quickly found myself riding/running/swimming distances I'd never thought possible. Around 2020, I shifted to cycling only, and for a while I was **really** into [ultra-distance cycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-distance_cycling). Here are a couple examples: 
- [Boulder to Vail](https://www.strava.com/activities/7133415452)
- [Unbound 200](https://www.strava.com/activities/7256188457) 
- [Tour de Croc](https://www.strava.com/activities/7348087456)
- [East Texas Showdown](https://www.strava.com/activities/8737219081)
However, I increasingly found myself at odds with the whole point of excercising: to be the strongest, healthiest version of myself. And being fit on the bike optimizes for two very specific things: cardiovascular fitness and low weight. I felt weak off the bike and nursing overuse injuries, so I decided to add some variety with strength training and running.  

# Sleep 

I aim for at least 8 hours of sleep a night. I've found that any extra work hours I get from sleeping less are completely offset by the reduced productivity. I've tried tracking sleep with devices like Whoop, but I didn't find the data very actionable. Honestly, sleeping enough and keeping a consistent sleep schedule is all you really need. Here's the podcast where I first heard about the importance of sleep:

# Supplements

I do not recommend taking any supplemenets without consulting a doctor. Here's a list I've put together that includes the supplements I take, what they're for and price/mg. My favorite are: 
- **Caffeine**. The cognitive benefits of caffeine are undeniable. Taking too much gets me a little too wound up so I really only take it once or twice a week. Big fan of using for hard workouts too. 
- **Omega 3s**. Pretty compelling evidence that they're safe and good for your brain . Easy to 
- **Electrolytes**. I sweat *a lot* (as in 2+L/hour on a hot Texas day), and I lose about 1g of sodium per hour. It took me way too long to realize that much of the mental fog I was experiencing was due to dehydration and I found that 1-2 LMNT packets a day is immensely helpful (more on days where I have long workouts outside). I'm a big fan of them since they have no added sugar taste decently well. 


# Measurements 

I try to get bloodwork done at least once every 6 months. I'm generally looking at my testosterone, cholesterol, and blood counts. I've also recently started getting DEXA scans once or twice a year, which is very helpful in measuring body composition changes as I'v added more weighlifting into my routine. I also keep track of sleep hours and weight. I'm interested in testing out continuous glucose monitors and some portable metabolic testing devices, and I may give HRV tracking another shot.

title: Health and Longevity
---
I'm a big fan of excercise and understanding how my body works. I'm also an engineer and I like measuring stuff, so I've spent a lot of time reading about longevity, excercise, diet, and [Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self). Here's a list of what I do to stay healthy, and some of the resources I've found helpful.

# Exercise

Why I exercise
* I'm curious and I love to get outside to explore new places.
* I love testing my physical and mental limits.
* It feels great!
* It's a great way to meet people.
* I've got a family history of obesity and diabetes, and I want to avoid that.

My current focus is on strength and endurance so my weekly routine consists of 3-4 weighlifting sessions (I follow the [ATG program](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/)), and a mix of cycling and running (coached by [Brad Seng](https://www.d3multisport.com/our-coaches/brad-seng)). I try to get at least one high-intensity cardio workout a week (e.g. intervals on the run, or a hard group ride/race on the bike), and one long ride (3+ hrs). I also don't have a car, so I move on a bike most of the time, amounting to an extra 2-3 hours of low-intensity cardio a week.

Altough I grew up playing sports, I never trained for anything seriously. This changed when I moved to Boulder and I joined the [CU Triathlon Team](https://www.cutriathlon.com/). Training for a sport like triathlon requires a consistency and structure that spoke to my left-brain inclinations. Even though getting the habit flywheel moving was increadibly challenging, I quickly found myself riding/running/swimming distances I'd never thought possible. Around 2020, I shifted to cycling only, and for a while I was **really** into [ultra-distance cycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-distance_cycling). Here are a couple examples: 
- [Boulder to Vail](https://www.strava.com/activities/7133415452)
- [Unbound 200](https://www.strava.com/activities/7256188457) 
- [Tour de Croc](https://www.strava.com/activities/7348087456)
- [East Texas Showdown](https://www.strava.com/activities/8737219081)
However, I increasingly found myself at odds with the whole point of excercising: to be the strongest, healthiest version of myself. And being fit on the bike optimizes for two very specific things: cardiovascular fitness and low weight. I felt weak off the bike and nursing overuse injuries, so I decided to add some variety with strength training and running.  

There is also a practical reason I excercise: I have a family history of obesity and diabetes, and even with my relatively active lifestyle, I'm still at risk (as evidenced by my [bloodwork](#measurements)).

# Sleep 

I aim for the following: 
* ~8 hours of sleep a night. 
* A dark, cool room (eye masks are great).
* Avoid bright lights 1-2 hours before bed. 
* Consistent timing. 
* Morning sunlight. 
  
I've found that any extra work hours I get from sleeping less are mostly offset by the reduced productivity. And, there are correlations between bad sleep and [diabetes](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/diabetes-discoveries-practice/the-impact-of-poor-sleep-on-type-2-diabetes) as well as cognitive decline (to no one's surprise). I've tried tracking sleep with devices like Whoop, but I didn't find the data to be very actionable. Honestly, sleeping enough and keeping a consistent sleep schedule is all you really need. [Here's the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk) where I first heard about the importance of sleep. 

# Supplements

I do not recommend taking any supplemenets without first consulting a doctor. [Here's a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SLvUedtbfI9P0huaCIQEsxESnAF2JUXrzqLDqs1By6k/edit#gid=0) I've put together that includes the supplements I take, what they're for, and approximate price/mg. My favorite are: 
- **Caffeine**. The cognitive benefits of caffeine are undeniable. I'm very sensitive to it so I only partake once or twice a week. I'm a big fan of using for hard workouts too. Really affects my sleep so I avoid it after 12pm. 
- **Electrolytes**. I sweat *a lot* (as in 2+L/hour on a hot Texas day), and I lose about 1g of sodium per liter of sweat. It took me way too long to realize that much of the mental fog I was experiencing was due to dehydration, and I've found that 1-2 [LMNT](https://drinklmnt.com/) packets a day are immensely helpful (more on days where I have long workouts outside). I'm a big fan of them since they have no added sugar and taste ok. 
- **Vitamin D**. There's [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9671203/) of a significant association between low vitamin D levels and diabetes, as well as [increased mortality](https://gwern.net/longevity#vitamin-d). Given how cheap it is and my family history, I supplement with 4000-5000 IU a day.

# Diet 
I've tried all sorts of diets and I've found the most sustainable approach are the following guidelines:
- Eat whole foods and at least one serving of vegetables a day. 
- Avoid added sugar.
- ~2.0 - 2.5g of protein per kg of bodyweight per day.
- If bulking eat at a slight caloric surplus (10-15%).
- If cutting eat at a slight caloric deficit (10-15%). Err on the side of eating more. Don't overdo this. 
- Avoid (processed, high-sugar, or high-fat foods) when I'm tired, stressed, or hungry.
- No alcohol. 
I'm not a monk, and of course there's exceptions. I track my weight daily for fun, but I mostly look for long-term trends (i.e. whether I'm bulking, cutting, or staying), and I don't stress out over short-term fluctuations.

I try to never workout fasted. I normally aim to replace what I burn (in terms of calories), but if I'm training for an important event I'll also aim for 100-120g of carbs per hour. This is a non-trivial amount (equivalent to around 3 Clif bars per hour), so I use specialized products like Maurten or Neversecond. 

# Measurements 

This is what I consistently measure: 
* Every 6 months: bloodwork (looking at testosterone, cholesterol, and blood counts)
* Every 3 months: DEXA scan (depending on whether I'm trying to change body composition)
* Every day: weight, sleep hours

Regular bloodwork is how I first found out that my blood glucose was on the upper end of normal (~5.5% HbA1c and fasting blood glucose ~93 mg/dL) and my "good" cholesterol was on the lower end of normal (4.8 HDL mg/dL). I consulted with an endocrinologist and this is likely due to genetic predispositions. The good news is that I can probably keep it in check with a healthy diet, excercise, and sleep.  

I've also tried out continuous glucose monitors and HRV tracking, and I'm always interested in trying out new gadgets.

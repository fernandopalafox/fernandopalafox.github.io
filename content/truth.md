title: Why You Should Face Truth
draft: false
---

A life worth living is one of adventure, and the greatest source of adventure is the truth.
But facing the truth is very hard. 
So here is why you should face it. 

Truth is what you see, say, or feel when you let go who you think you should be, how things should be, or you should feel. 
The systematic process of uncovering truth is also known as science. [^1]
Truth is not what you wish things would be, it's what they actually are. 
Truth is what you see when you look at the mirror. 
It is the way people treat you.
It is how you look.
It is your spouse. 
It is your career. 
It is your health.
It is your talents.
It is your mistakes. 
It is your insecurities. 
It is your responsibilities.
It is not your potential, it is what you've done. 
It's what you feel when you stop avoiding uncomfortable emotions.

Facing truth means you stop avoiding the uncomfortable.
For example, this may be accepting that your relationship is toxic, you use hobbies to avoid responsibility, you care too much about what people think, you distracts yourself from hard emotions with pleasure, you don't work as hard as you could, you hate yourself, you have bad friends, your job is a dead-end, or you avoid hard conversations. 
If any of this makes you uncomfortable, it's probably because it's true. 
Wil you let these uncomfortable truths drag you down into a bottomless pit of resentment, cynicism, and selfishness?
Or will you face them and get better?

Truth is the ultimate adventure because it does not depend on what you know, like, think, or want. 
And I think you should face it because what is more adventurous, more uncertain, more worthy than going headfirst into the dark forest of reality?

> "If I know what I shall find, I do not want to find it. Uncertainty is the salt of life" - Erwin Chargaff

You should face truth because it will force you to become the best version of yourself. 
Truth shines a bright light on what you lack. 
When you face it and ask "why did I fail?" or "how can I be better?" (and you also want the answer) you can begin to improve. 
And if you don't feel like you deserve becoming a better person, think of the people you love.
Pursue truth for them, because if you don't, someone else will eventually carry the burden you're avoiding.

When you face truth, you let go of your identity.
Think of how much energy you spend maintaining the identity defined by yourself, society, friends, family, and social media.
Perhaps you're known as the generous, hospitable person only because you're afraid of facing all the anger and resentment lives inside of you.
Or perhaps you try to be as independent and competent as possible because you're afraid of feeling dependent. 
And there is no way that your identity would ever allow that, because your identity has the labels: independent, competent, and resourceful.
We all have faults, vices and bag habits. 
Some of them are easy to recognize, but some of them are so scary, so against who we're "supposed" to be, that we spend an immense amount of effort trying to pretend they don't exist.
But in a war against yourself, you'll never win. 
And the only way to become the best version of yourself is by surrendering yourself to the truth and accepting your shadow. 
And when you do, perhaps you'll find an immense amount of power you never knew you had.

However, facing truth is harder than avoiding it and will always come with some sacrifice. 
To me, this has meant buckling down on work and missing out on parties and travel and losing some friends. 
To you, the sacrifice may be different, but it will be there.
As Christopher Hitchins said: 
> "In life you most choose your regrets."

So, choose wisely.

If you don't face truth, sooner or later, it will come knocking at your door. 
The hard work you avoided today? Your career will reflect it in a couple years.
The terrible way you treat your body? Good luck with medical bills and shame as your body begins to falls apart. 
The toxic relationship you avoid leaving? It may legitimately derail your life. 
Every bit of truth you avoid today is using up some part of your future.

Living in a lie may feel like a safer alternative, but that's only because you get control over the walls of lies you build around truth.
The force of reality stands behind truth and no amount of distraction, pleasure, or manipulation will ever fool nature.
The more time you spend in bad relationships, avoiding responsibility or distracting yourself from uncomfortable emotions, the bigger the monster under the bed grows. 
And the bigger the monster, the larger the corresponding sacrifice you'll have to make when to face it.
Let it grow too big, and it may just destroy you.

One way of getting started in facing truth is to surround yourself with good friends.
They will be your biggest critics in private and your biggest supporters in public. 
They will carve out the mediocre in you and will not tolerate cynicism, avoidance, or self-pity. 
They also won't allow you to give up on your dreams.
On the other hand, bad friends will help maintain the walls you've built around truth.
They likely won't do this out of evil, but because they're also avoiding something in their lives, and you serve a similar role in their life. 
In a bad friendship, you join an implicit agreement never to call each other out on the real problems you're avoiding. 
And even if you manage to slap yourself awake from this, a bad friend will try to drag you down as your search for truth shines a light on their faults.[^2]
They will resent you for constantly reminding them of the dreams they gave up on, or the sacrifices they didn't make.
Good friends help you face truth, bad friends help you avoid it.

Personally, this is something I struggle with a lot. 
I avoid feeling abandonment or incompetence at all costs. 
But in avoiding these feelings I've repeatedly made friends with people that don't value me for who I am, only for what I do in the service of some identity.
Letting go of these relationships has been really hard, but it really is the best way forward for all parties involved.
Figure out who the good friends are and cut out the bad ones. 
If you feel selfish doing this, consider the toxic role you serve in their lives as well, and get out.

Instead, surround yourself by courageous people. 
As Anaïs Nin said 
> "life expands or shrinks according to one's courage".

So find people that aren't afraid of calling you out on your bullshit. 
People that celebrate you for facing your biggest fears. 
People that support you when times are hard, and sober you up when times are good.
And ask yourself: 
Is your partner courageous? 
Are your friends courageous? 
You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. 
So, choose wisely. 

If you're reading this, you very likely have a life of privilege beyond the wildest dreams of millions of people around the world. 
So, honor the sacrifices made by parents, teachers, friends, and strangers and become the best person you can be. 
If not for you, then do it for the people you love, because they will bear your burden if you don't. 
There is never a perfect time to leave that bad relationship, learn to face your insecurities, leave that job you hate, or go back to school. 
As C.S. Lewis wrote at the height of World War Two: 

> “We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. 
> If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. 
> The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. 
> Favorable conditions never come.”

So, accept responsibility for who you are and start doing something about it. 
Sometimes, facing this responsibility will be easier than you expect.
As the saying goes, 
> "if you face your deepest fears, you may never have to meet them." 

In most cases, it won't be easy -- but, what were you expecting? 
Did you really think that a worthy life was going to be easy?
Well, this is what hard feels like. 
Take a moment and pay attention to whatever it is you have have been pretending doesn't exist.
And face it. 
Today.

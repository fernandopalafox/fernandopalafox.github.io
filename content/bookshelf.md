## Favorites

**David Deutsch** *The Beginning of Infinity* [\[Link to my notes\]](infinity.md)
> "The uniquely significant thing about humans is our ability to create new explanations"

> "We are fallible, but through conjecture, criticism, and seeking good explanations we correct some of our errors"

**Thomas S. Kuhn** *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*
> "Scientific fact and theory are not categorically separable"

**David Foster Wallace** *Infinite Jest*

**Henry Hazlitt** *Economics in One Lesson*
> "Depth in economics consists in looking for all the consequences of a policy instead of merely resting one's gaze on those immediately visible."

**Fyodor Dostoevsky** *Crime and Punishment* 
> "Power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up" ... "One has only to dare!"
## Notable mentions

**Kurt Vonnegut** *Cat's Cradle*
> “Man blinked. “What is the purpose of all this?” he asked politely. “Everything must have a purpose?” asked God. “Certainly,” said man. “Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,” said God. And he went away."

**Nick Bostrom** *Superintelligence*
> "If an agent is not fundamentally friendly by the time it gains the ability to reflect on its own agency, it will not take kindly to efforts at brainwashing."

**Ray Dalio** *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order*

**Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman** *Gödel's Proof*

**Adam Gazzaley and Larry D. Rosen** *The Distracted Mind*

**Adam Smith** *The Wealth of Nations*
> "What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom."

**Donald Hoffman** *The Case Against Reality*

**Sam Harris** *Waking Up*

**Viktor Frankl** *Man's Search for Meaning*
>"Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked."

**Isaac Asimov** The *Foundation* series

**Alfred Lansing** *Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage*

**Walter Isaacson** *Einstein: His Life and Universe*

**Michael Pollan** *How to Change Your Mind*

**Luke Burgis** *Wanting*

**Neal Stephenson** *Snow Crash* 

**Albert Camus** *The Stranger*

**Aldous Huxley** *The Doors of Perception*
> "My own belief is that, though they may start by being something of an embarrassment, these new mind changers will tend in the long run to deepen the spiritual life of the communities in which they are available. . . . From being an activity mainly concerned with symbols, religion will be transformed into an activity concerned mainly with experience and intuition — an everyday mysticism underlying and giving significance to everyday rationality, everyday tasks and duties, everyday human relationships."

I took the idea of a digital bookshelf from [Patrick Collison's blog](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf). The template for this page was partly inspired by [Joanne Peng's](https://www.joannepeng.com/lists) website.

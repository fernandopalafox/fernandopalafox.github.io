**Why You Should Face Truth**

I think that a life worth living is one of adventure, and the greatest source of adventure is the truth.
But facing the truth is hard though. 
So here is why you should face it. 

Truth is what you see, say, or feel when you let go who you think you should be, things should be, or you should feel. 
The systematic process of uncovering truth is also known as science. [^1]
Truth is not what you wish things would be, it's what they actually are. 
Truth is what you see when you look at the mirror. 
It is the way people treat you.
It is how you look.
It is your spouse. 
It is your career. 
It is your health.
It is your talents.
It is your mistakes. 
It is your insecurities. 
It is your responsibilities.
It's what you feel when you stop avoiding uncomfortable emotions.
Truth is not your potential, it is what you've done. 

Facing truth means you stop avoiding the uncomfortable.
For example, it may mean accepting that your relationship is toxic, that you use silly hobbies to avoid responsibility, that you care too much about what people think, that you distracts yourself from hard emotions with pleasure, that you don't work as hard as you should, that you hate yourself, that you have bad friends, that your job is a dead-end, or that you avoid hard conversations. 
If any of this makes you uncomfortable, it's probably because it's true. 
But now that you've faced the truth, you can do something about it. 
Wil you let these uncomfortable truths drag you down into a bottomless pit of resentment, cynicism, and selfishness?
Will you use them to get better?

Truth is the ultimate adventure because it does not depend on what you know, like, think, or want. 
And I think you should face it because what is more adventurous, more uncertain, more worthy than going headfirst into the dark forest of reality?

You should face truth because it will force you to become the best version of yourself. 
Because truth shines a bright light on what you lack. 
When you face the truth and ask "why did this fail?" or "how can I be better?" (and you also want the answer) you can begin do something about your situation. 
And if you don't feel like you deserve becoming a better person (and there many such cases), think the people you love. 
Pursue truth for them, because if you don't become the best person you can, someone else will eventually carry the burden you're avoiding.

When you face truth, you let go of the identity you spend so much energy maintaining. 
Personally, this experience feels like driving down a hill with no brakes.
When I stop clinging to the stories I tell myself about experience, and instead just take them for what they are, I typically feel panic.
Because I'm used to being in control, but part of facing truth is accepting that you really can't control truth.
Facing truth means I stop building a story about why I'm anxious, angry, sad, happy, or ashamed. 
I accept and lean into these emotions. 
I begin to accept my flaws, talents, life situation, mistakes, and fully lean into them.

When you face truth you let go of the identity defined by yourself, society, friends, family, and social media.
As you let go of identity, and [do your job](https://www.attentiveman.com/blog-1/2019/1/31/kq48odczcbpti3ugxy3hcig6zx6bgm), you'll slowly become better.
My friend Dan recently reminded me of this great Latin proverb: 
> "Cuando te toca, ni aunque te quites y cuando no te toca, ni aunque te pongas"
Which loosely translates to "When it's your turn, it doesn't matter if try to avoid it, and when it's not your turn, you won't get it even if you try."
Face truth, surrender yourself to life, and things will fall into place. 

However, facing truth is harder than avoiding it and will always come with some sacrifice. 
To me, this has meant buckling down and missing out on a bunch of parties, losing some friends, and not going on some trips. 
To you, the sacrifice may be different, but it will nonetheless be there. 
As Christopher Hitchins said "In life you most choose your regrets". 
So, choose wisely.

If you don't face truth, sooner or later, it will come knocking at your door. 
The hard work you avoided today? You'll see this reflected in you career in a couple years
The terrible way you treat your body? Good luck with medical bills and shame as your body falls apart. 
That toxic relationship? It may legitimately derail your life in a couple years. 
Every bit of truth you avoid today is using up some part of your future.

Living in a lie may feel like a safer alternative, but that's only because of the temporary control over the mental bubble you build around yourself. 
The force of reality stands behind truth and no amount of distraction, pleasure, or manipulation will ever fool nature.
The more time you spend entertaining bad relationships, avoiding responsibility or uncomfortable emotions, the bigger the monster under the bed grows. 
And the bigger the monster, the larger the corresponding sacrifice you'll have to make.
Let it grow too big, and it may just destroy you.

One way of getting started in facing truth is to surround yourself with good friends.
Good friends will carve out the mediocre parts of you.
They will be your biggest critics in private and your biggest supporters in public. 
They won't tolerate cynicism, avoidance, or self-pity. 
They won't allow you to give up on your dreams.
On the other hand, bad relationships will help maintain the walls you've built around truth.
Many times, they won't do this out of evil, but because they're also avoiding something in their lives, and you serve a similar role in their life. 
In a bad relationship, you join an implicit agreement never to call each out on the real problems you're avoiding. 
And even if you manage to slap yourself awake from this, bad friends will drag you down as your sincere and intense conviction for truth shines a light on their faults.[^2]
They will resent you for constantly reminding them of the dreams they gave up on, or the sacrifices they didn't make.
Good friends help you face truth, bad friends help you avoid it. 

Personally, this is something I struggle with a lot. 
I avoid feeling abandonment or incompetence at all costs. 
But in avoiding these feelings I've repeatedly made friends with people that don't value me for who I am. 
Letting go of these relationships has been really hard, but it really is the only way forward for all parties involved.
You're wasting everyone's time the more you spend here. 
Part of facing truth in this respect has meant I asked myself the following question: "Do my friends love me for who I am or what I do?"[^1]. 

Instead, surround yourself by courageous people. 
As Anaïs Nin said "life expands or shrinks according to one's courage".
So find people that aren't afraid of calling you out on your bullshit. 
The kind of people that celebrate you for becoming better. 
And ask yourself: 
Is your partner courageous? 
Are your friends courageous? 
You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. 
So, choose wisely. 

If you're reading this, you live a life of privilege beyond the wildest dreams of billions of people. 
So, honor the parents, teachers, friends, and strangers that sacrificed for you and become the best person you can be. 
If not for you, then do it for the people you love, because they will bear your burden if you don't. 
There is never a perfect time to leave that bad relationship, learn to face your crippling anxiety, or leave that job you hate. 
As C.S. Lewis wrote at the height of World War Two: 

> “We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. 
> If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. 
> The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. 
> Favorable conditions never come.”

So, accept responsibility for who you are and start doing something about it. 
In some cases, facing this responsibility will be easier than you expected.
As the saying goes, "if you face your deepest fears, you may never have to meet them." 
In most cases, it won't be easy, but what were you expecting? 
Did you really think that the worthiest of lives wasn't going to be hard? 
Well, this is what hard feels like. 
If you don't know how to get started, take a moment and pay attention to whatever it is you have have been pretending doesn't exist.
And face it.

[^1] As legendary physicist Richard Feynman put it: "Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves".
[^2] Do you love yourself for what you do or who you are? 
[^3] Personally, one of the hardest aspects of facing truth has been the resistance I've felt from those closest to me (I wrote about it [here](unreasonable.md))

**An obligation to do great things**

We have an obligation to do great things. 
Because the truth is, the world is a fragile place with unimaginable amounts of suffering, and it won't get any better by itself. 
Things don't just happen by default, built it.
It took the great work and sacrifice of many people to build the world we have today. 
We have many, many problems to fix, but the truth of the matter is that the world has never been a better place. 
And there is also no middle: if you're not making the world a better place, you're actively dragging down those who are.

Greatness may sound intimidating, but it may be a lot more straightforward than you realize.
I define greatness as whatever you can do to reduce the amount of suffering in the world. 
Perhaps greatness for you is to raise a family. 
Perhaps it's to spend some of your time volunteering at a local shelter. 
At the end of the day, everyone has a role in the world. 
You are responsible for yourself, because if you don't take care of yourself, someone else will. 
Although this may sound counterintuitive to some people, greatness may involve a great deal of self-care. 
Because if you don't take care of yourself, eventually, someone else will have to. 
This means that greatness for you may mean brushing your teeth, making your bed every morning, or exercising for a bit. 
Or, perhaps it is literally to change the world. 
Orient yourself towards truth, no matter how uncomfortable, break down the steps, and you will find what it is you should do next. 
Aiming high is accesible to everyone, but only if you are honest with yourself. 
Perhaps aiming high means taking stock of the situation and looking around you. 

Whatever greatness means for you, you have a duty to pursue it. 
Because life is hard, and if you can't rest easy knowing that you did your best, no matter the sacrifice, you will end up bitter and resentful. 
If you avoid aiming for greatness, you will inevitably try to bring down all those who do, because they will remind you of the dreams you gave up on. 
They will remind you of the sacrifices you were not willing to make.

"We regret the things we didn't do more than the things we did. 
The pain of trying and failying may be intense but at least it tends to be over rather quickly. 
The pain of failintg to try, on the other hand, is less intense but neer really goes away." 

**Being**

When you're ripped away from the warm embrace of innocence you have two choices: get scared and 

That real life can be terrifying and brutal. 

It is getting terrified by the immensity and the brutality of Being, and deciding to do it scared. 

It means accepting the resentment that's felt after being ripped away from innocence

That the only way back to innocence is to try and blind oneself. 

It is learning that cynical person will become selfishness and destroy those who are trying to make it.

It is the understanding, to your bones, that change is the only constant. 

It is looking at the mirror, accepting all your flaws

It is understanding how special and delicate our existence is

It is understanding that wishing for the present to be anything but what it is, only leads to pain

It is learning that we dont choose whether we believe or not, we choose what to believe in. And this is likely the most important decision we'll ever make. Choose incorrectly and the hardships of life will drown you in hopelessness, resentment, and arrogance. 

That attachment really is the source of all suffering. 

It is realizing that the the world exists in a delicate balance between progress and decay. There is no in between. 

That the sooner you let go of who you think you are, the sooner you'll find who you actually are. 

That everything really is a skill issue. 

That what is expedient is not what matters. 

That you can only properly listen by letting go of pride. 

That you are the only person responsible for your own happiness.

That it takes effort to maintain any emotion. They literally all go away on their own after a bit. 

The lack of certainty makes it worth it. 

> "If i know what I shall find, I do not want to find it. Uncertainty is the salf of life" - Erwin Chargaff

No one is more keenly aware of our faults than ourselves. So treat yourself with kindness. 

You aren't the best judge of what you need. And it is easy to delude yourself into believing what you need. 
- Most of the time, we're not the best judges for what is best for us. And if we ever do get it, it can quickly turn into an addictive dependence. 
Fortunately, what's best for us is generally accesible, but only if we can let go of our identities. 
Of the idea we hold on how we should act, who we should be, what we should do, who should like us, who you talk to, who follows you, who you follow. 

Small problems sweeped under a rug will grow into legitimate chaos if you don't face them. 

**Relationships**


It is learning that not everyone can be trusted

It is learning that parents make mistakes too

It is learning that kindness is always the appropriate response.

It is understanding that Solzhenitsyn was right when he said that "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained"

It is learning that some people simply do not want to be helped

That it's easier to be dragged down than it is to pull someone up
That some people don't believe that they deserve any better or don't want the trouble of getting to it. 

It is understanding that self-sacrifice for someone else's wellbeing can paradoxically be completely selfish. 

It is learning that you can only get stepped on if you lay down.

It is understanding that ceaseless motion may hide problems, but it won't fix them.

That you really have no choice over what you feel. 

That good friends will not tolerate cynicism or destructiveness. 

That good friends will, in a painful process, carve out the bad, the mediocre, the bad. 

That it's harder to surround yourself by good people than bad people

That bad friends will drag you down as your success shines a light on their faults. 


**Love**
It is learning that we don't choose who we love. 

It is learning that opening one's heart cannot be done at a safe distance.
It is learning that opening one's heart is always worth it.

That it's beautiful we ever fall in love enough to get heartbroken.

That when you put someone on a pedestal, you fall in love with your idea of them. And that places undue pressure on them. 


"The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance"

Here are a couple lessons I've learned in the past couple of months
They're grouped into three topics: [Truth](#truth), [Being](#being), and [relationships](#relationships). 

**Why You Should Face Truth**

What kind of life is worth living? 
How much should I sacrifice in pursuit of my goals? 
How much sacrifice is too much sacrifice? 
I think that a life worth living is one of relentless pursuit of adventure, and the greatest source of adventure is the truth.
This is why you should face truth.

Truth is what you see, say, or feel when you let go who you think you are, how you think things should be, how you think you should feel. 
The systematic process of uncovering truth is also known as science. [^1]
Truth is not what you wish things would be, it's what they actually are. 
Truth is what you see when you look at the mirror. 
It is the way people treat you.
It is the way you look. 
It is your career. 
It is your faults. 
It is your health.
It is your talents.
It is your insecurities. 
It is your responsibilities
It's what you feel when you stop avoiding uncomfortable emotions.
Truth is not your "potential", it is what you've done. 
Truth is revealed when you try something and fail. 

Truth is the ultimate adventure because it does not depend on what you know, like, think, or want. 
What is more adventurous, more uncertain, more worthy than going headfirst into the dark forest of reality? 

> "If i know what I shall find, I do not want to find it. Uncertainty is the salt of life" - Erwin Chargaff

You should live in truth because it will force you to become the best version of yourself. 
Because truth shines a bright light on what you lack. 
When you face the truth you don't only ask the questions, "why did this fail?" or "How can I be better?", it means you also want the answer. 
Truth forces you to engage with every part of our conscious experience, both the good and the bad. 
But the only way you can begin to do something about your faults is by accepting them!
If you don't feel like you deserve becoming a better person (many such cases), think about it in terms of the people you love. 
Pursue truth for them, because if you don't become the best person you can, someone else will eventually carry the burden you're avoiding. 

When you face truth, you will let go of the identity you spend so much energy maintaining. 
Personally, this experience feels like driving down a hill and finding that my brakes have failed.
Everytime I let got a new piece of my identity, I feel panic as I completely relinquish control. 
I begin to accept my flaws, talents, life situation, mistakes, and fully lean into them. 
I stop the mental control over my mental filter of the situation and just take things for what they are.  
But this is very scary! 
> "The bad news is you’re falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there’s no ground.”
> ― Chögyam Trungpa
However, this lack of control is liberating in a sense, because it means that I can let go an fully hand myself over to life. 

By facing truth, you can begin to become who you are meant to be. 
When you face truth you let go of the identity that society, your friends, family, and social media is trying to turn you into, and fully hand yourself over to life.
And if you allow yourself to let go of this sense of identity, things will fall into place. 
My friend Dan recently reminded me of this great Latin proverb: 
> "Cuando te toca, ni aunque te quites y cuando no te toca, ni aunque te pongas"
Which loosely translates to "When it's your turn, it doesn't matter if try to avoid it, and when it's not your turn, you won't get it even if you try."
Face truth, surrender yourself to life, and things will fall into place. 

None of this is to say that it will be easy. 
In fact, living in truth is harder than not living in truth. 
You will find that facing it will require some significant sacrifices. 
When you accept the sacrifice that comes with facing truth, you will likely be left with some regrets over the friends you lost, the parties parties, and trips you didn't take. 
But as Christopher Hitchins said it bet: "In life you most choose your regrets". 
So, choose wisely. 

By recognizing where your flaws are, where your talents are, and what your situation is, you will likely inch closer to what your role in this world is. 
And fulfilling this role will require some sacrifice.
But the truth of the matter is that any life worth living will require some sacrifice.   
And if you don't feel like you're sacrificing something right now, like you're not facing an uncomfortable truth. 
Well, buckle down, because something will break, eventually. 
Any tiny bit of uncomfortable truth you sweep under a rug will always grow into legimitate chaos if you don't face it. 
Atonement when straying from truth will require sacrifice, and let this dragon grow to big, and the sacrifice may take everything from you. 
If you're going through sacrifice right now, a part of you must recognize and knew at some point that what you were trying to do wuould be hard. 
And well, this is what hard feels like. 

> "The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek" - Joseph Campbell 

If you don't face truth, sooner or later, it will come knocking at your door. 
The hard work you avoided today? You'll see this reflected in you career in a couple years
The dentist appointments you avoided today will leave you with a heap of medical problems and shame later on. 
The toxic relationship you avoided leaving will dramatically explode at some point. 
Every bit of truth you avoid today is using up some part of your future. 

Living in a life may temporarily feel better because you have some degree of control over the bubble you build around yourself. 
Personally, I like feeling under control, and letting go of it is scary. 

Living in a lie may feel like a safer alternative, but that's only because of the temporary control over the mental bubble you build around yourself. 
The force of reality stands behind truth and no amount of distraction, pleasure, or manipulation will ever fool nature.
The more time you spend entertaining people bad relationships, avoiding responsibility or uncomfortable emotions, the bigger the monster under the bed grows. 
And the bigger the monster, the larger the corresponding sacrifice you will have to face. 
Let it grow too big, and it may just destroy you. 
The longer you avoid it, the deeper the hole you dig. 

One way of getting started in facing truth is to surround yourself with good relationships
That good friends will, in a sometimes painful process, carve out the mediocre parts of you.
If they love you, they will be your biggest critics in private and your biggest supporters in public. 
On the other hand, bad friends will drag you down as your sincere and intense conviction for truth shines a light on their faults.[^2]
They will resent you for constantly reminding them of the dreams they gave up on, or the sacrifices they didn't make.

Personally, I have sometimes struggled with finding good relationships.
Growing up I had trouble making friends and I was the opposite of charismatic. 
I am extremely sensitive to the feeling of abandonment, of feeling like I'm not enough.
This has manifested itself through a pattern of making friends with people that don't truly value me. 
Although I know this, I've tolerated it because: 
1. I wanted to avoid the feeling of abandonment at all costs.
2. These friends fill a requirement of my current identity. 
Facing this reality has involved accepting my insecurities around abandonment and then filtering friendships by asking:  "Do my friends love me for who I am or what I do?"[^1]
Bad relationships will contribute to the bubble of your life lie and continuously hand a beer to a recovering alcoholic. 
Most of time time it's not because they're Bad People. 
It's likely because they're also avoiding something in their lives, and you likely serve a similar role in their life. 
You form a bubble of dependence with an implicit agreemeent never to call each out on the real problems you're avoiding. 
In the same way it's easier to face reality with a good set of relationships, bad relationships will make it really easy who you avoid truth.

> Life expands or shrinks according to one's courage — Anaïs Nin, 1939

Instead, surround yourself by courageous people. 
People who aren't afraid of calling you out on your defects. 
People that are open to changing. 
Good relationships, the kind that stick through thick or thin, not responsibl for making you happy. 
They're there to support you in the mind-bending process of carving yourself into the best person you can be. 
they're there to constantly remind you that the only way is to orient yourself towards truth. 
After all, you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. 
Is your partner courageous? 
Are your friends courageous? 

> "If shit happens, do you overcome shit or do you become shit?" - Alex Hormozi

If you face truth, you're given access to the biggest priviledge in life: the chance to find meaning in truth. 
Perhaps the truth is you're working a dead-end job you don't like, you have a degenerative disease, you hate yourself, you care too much about what people think, you suck at your favorite hobby, or your friends don't respect you. 
Wil you let these uncomfortable truths drag you down into a bottomless pit of resentment, cynicism, and selfishness?
Will you accept face them and use them to be better? 
That if any of these comments gave you a negative reaction, it's probably because it's true ;) 

> “We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. 
> If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. 
> The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. 
> Favorable conditions never come.”  C.S. Lewis.

Get out there and face the truth.
if not for you, then do it for the people you love, because they will bear your burden if you don't. 
There is never a perfect time to leave that bad relationship, learn to face your crippling anxiety, or leave that job you hate. 
If you don't know how to get started, take a moment, pause for a second and pay attention to whatever you have been hiding ignoring or pretending doesn't exist.
Ask yourself: what feeling am I avoiding? Shame? Anger? Abandonment? Anxiety? Dependency? Insufficiency? Fear? Incompetence?
Face it. 
Only when you accept responsibility for who you are that you can do something about it. 
And if you do, it will likely be easier than you expect.
> "If you face your deepest fears, you may never have to meet them." 
And if it's not easy, what were you expecting. 
Did you really think aiming towards the worthiest of lives was going to be easy? 
No, you knew it was going to be hard. 
Well, this is what hard feels like. 
Once you decide to face truth, expect resistance from those closest to you.

[^1] As legendary physicist Richard Feynman put it: "Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves".
[^2] Do you love yourself for what you do or who you are? 
[^3] Personally, one of the hardest aspects of facing truth has been the resistance I've felt from those closest to me (I wrote about it [here](unreasonable.md))

**An obligation to do great things**

We have an obligation to do great things. 
Because the truth is, the world is a fragile place with unimaginable amounts of suffering, and it won't get any better by itself. 
Things don't just happen by default, built it.
It took the great work and sacrifice of many people to build the world we have today. 
We have many, many problems to fix, but the truth of the matter is that the world has never been a better place. 
And there is also no middle: if you're not making the world a better place, you're actively dragging down those who are.

Greatness may sound intimidating, but it may be a lot more straightforward than you realize.
I define greatness as whatever you can do to reduce the amount of suffering in the world. 
Perhaps greatness for you is to raise a family. 
Perhaps it's to spend some of your time volunteering at a local shelter. 
At the end of the day, everyone has a role in the world. 
You are responsible for yourself, because if you don't take care of yourself, someone else will. 
Although this may sound counterintuitive to some people, greatness may involve a great deal of self-care. 
Because if you don't take care of yourself, eventually, someone else will have to. 
This means that greatness for you may mean brushing your teeth, making your bed every morning, or exercising for a bit. 
Or, perhaps it is literally to change the world. 
Orient yourself towards truth, no matter how uncomfortable, break down the steps, and you will find what it is you should do next. 
Aiming high is accesible to everyone, but only if you are honest with yourself. 
Perhaps aiming high means taking stock of the situation and looking around you. 

Whatever greatness means for you, you have a duty to pursue it. 
Because life is hard, and if you can't rest easy knowing that you did your best, no matter the sacrifice, you will end up bitter and resentful. 
If you avoid aiming for greatness, you will inevitably try to bring down all those who do, because they will remind you of the dreams you gave up on. 
They will remind you of the sacrifices you were not willing to make.

"We regret the things we didn't do more than the things we did. 
The pain of trying and failying may be intense but at least it tends to be over rather quickly. 
The pain of failintg to try, on the other hand, is less intense but neer really goes away." 

**Being**

When you're ripped away from the warm embrace of innocence you have two choices: get scared and 

That real life can be terrifying and brutal. 

It is getting terrified by the immensity and the brutality of Being, and deciding to do it scared. 

It means accepting the resentment that's felt after being ripped away from innocence

That the only way back to innocence is to try and blind oneself. 

It is learning that cynical person will become selfishness and destroy those who are trying to make it.

It is the understanding, to your bones, that change is the only constant. 

It is looking at the mirror, accepting all your flaws

It is understanding how special and delicate our existence is

It is understanding that wishing for the present to be anything but what it is, only leads to pain

It is learning that we dont choose whether we believe or not, we choose what to believe in. And this is likely the most important decision we'll ever make. Choose incorrectly and the hardships of life will drown you in hopelessness, resentment, and arrogance. 

That attachment really is the source of all suffering. 

It is realizing that the the world exists in a delicate balance between progress and decay. There is no in between. 

That the sooner you let go of who you think you are, the sooner you'll find who you actually are. 

That everything really is a skill issue. 

That what is expedient is not what matters. 

That you can only properly listen by letting go of pride. 

That you are the only person responsible for your own happiness.

That it takes effort to maintain any emotion. They literally all go away on their own after a bit. 

The lack of certainty makes it worth it. 

> "If i know what I shall find, I do not want to find it. Uncertainty is the salf of life" - Erwin Chargaff

No one is more keenly aware of our faults than ourselves. So treat yourself with kindness. 

You aren't the best judge of what you need. And it is easy to delude yourself into believing what you need. 
- Most of the time, we're not the best judges for what is best for us. And if we ever do get it, it can quickly turn into an addictive dependence. 
Fortunately, what's best for us is generally accesible, but only if we can let go of our identities. 
Of the idea we hold on how we should act, who we should be, what we should do, who should like us, who you talk to, who follows you, who you follow. 

Small problems sweeped under a rug will grow into legitimate chaos if you don't face them. 

**Relationships**


It is learning that not everyone can be trusted

It is learning that parents make mistakes too

It is learning that kindness is always the appropriate response.

It is understanding that Solzhenitsyn was right when he said that "The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained"

It is learning that some people simply do not want to be helped

That it's easier to be dragged down than it is to pull someone up
That some people don't believe that they deserve any better or don't want the trouble of getting to it. 

It is understanding that self-sacrifice for someone else's wellbeing can paradoxically be completely selfish. 

It is learning that you can only get stepped on if you lay down.

It is understanding that ceaseless motion may hide problems, but it won't fix them.

That you really have no choice over what you feel. 

That good friends will not tolerate cynicism or destructiveness. 

That good friends will, in a painful process, carve out the bad, the mediocre, the bad. 

That it's harder to surround yourself by good people than bad people

That bad friends will drag you down as your success shines a light on their faults. 


**Love**
It is learning that we don't choose who we love. 

It is learning that opening one's heart cannot be done at a safe distance.
It is learning that opening one's heart is always worth it.

That it's beautiful we ever fall in love enough to get heartbroken.

That when you put someone on a pedestal, you fall in love with your idea of them. And that places undue pressure on them. 


"The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance"

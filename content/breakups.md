I'm currently going through a hard breakup. We ended the relationship on good terms and the reasons were relatively benign. In the long run, this may even be better for both of us, especially given our current priorities. 
I'm also old enough to know that time, does indeed, heal all wounds. 
Still, no amount of reflecting turns off the whirlwind of emotions I feel right now. 

Perhaps one of the most memorable experiences I've had in my life was lying in next to her, looking straight into her eyes and realizing that in her gaze I saw everything. 
I realize how corny this sounds, but believe me, in that moment, looking at her eyes was like seeing the Milky Way on a starry night. 
The meaning of my life was realized in her big blue eyes. 
Nothing else mattered. 
I've never felt anything like that before. 
And I guess that when you're lucky enough to meet someone that elicits those emotions, they become part of who you are. 
And I mean this literally: she became a part of who I am, a part of the substance, the experience, the feeling I refer to as "me". 
And right now, the idea of continuing life without her is unfathomable. 
No, I am not suicidal. 
What I'm saying that my current conception of self is not compatible with a the future without her. 
It feels like someone asking me to look without using my eyes. 
To speak without using my mouth. 
I don't this mean to sound like a [koan](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/koan), but I'm trying to convey what it feels like when my understanding of who I am in the world feels thoroughly incompatible with a future without her. 
I constantly find myself making projections about the future, and the moment I realize she won't be there, I get the same split-second feeling of falling you get when sitting back on a chair that you thought was there but wasn't. 
Or when you take a step and there's no ground beneath you. 

This experience has certainly been a bit disorienting. 
And I've had some pretty bad dats, but it's been getting better as I've started to really assimilate the notion that my idea of "self" is not static (and an [illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fajfkO_X0l0)). 
My current sense of "self" may not be compatible with a future without her. 
But it won't need to be, because it will change. 
The melancholic in me gets a bif sad thinking about this. 
It feels like I'm leaving behind a time in my life that was so happy, special and full of so much love and growth. 
But I guess that's part of growing up.
I guess the message is that if you're going through situation similar to mine, and the end seems nigh, trust that it will get better. 
And you'll also come out the other a side a stronger person. 

Another reflection (perhaps something worth writing a separate post about), is my understanding on my place in a relationship.
Should I really be letting the idea that I identify as "me" depend on someone else?
If anything that can taken away is not really yours, [(*omnia mea mecum sunt!*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnia_mea_mecum_porto), then how much should I let another person what I think of as myself? 
I'm not sure, but perhaps this is also what makes relationships so special. 
If she hadn't become a part of me, would I have really seen the universe in her eyes? 
But also, love is so unpredictable, so do we even have the choice in letting someone become a part of who we are? 

I'm sure I'll look back at this in a few months and laugh at how dramatic I was being. 
Whatever the case may be, it's been very cathartic to navigate these feelings and ideas without judgement, so I'll let myself be sad for a bit.

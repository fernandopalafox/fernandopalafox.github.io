Prior to joining UT Austin, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder. During my time there, I worked on satellite navigation technologies and software-defined radios at the [RF & SatNav Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/rf-satnav/) with [Dr. Dennis Akos](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/dennis-akos).

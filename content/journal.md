I've lost a ton of motivation for journaling. 
I used to religiously write about my day, what time I woke up, what I did, where I went, who I talked to, what I felt. 
Most of the times it was a bit of a chore.
Sitting down to recap my entire day, by hand, after a long day at work, was not exactly my idea of a relaxing evenining. 
And when I left it for later, the accumulating stress of knowing I hadn't written about my days
And even after coming up with a bunch of ways of making it more efficient, like typing instead of writing or even voice recordings.

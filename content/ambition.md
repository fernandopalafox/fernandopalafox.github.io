title: How to be ambitious without destroying yourself
---

What is the purpose of this reflection? Talk about how I approach ambition and amor fati. 

How does one manage the tension between ambition and *amor fati*

This is a question I keep asking myself. Something That I've only recently learned about myself. I've always been a very ambitious person. I feel like I have potential and I want to make the best of it. Working towards big goals and ideas is how I find meaning in life. But growing up, I had slightly neuorotic tendencies. I had a bias towards extreme self-doubt and depressive episodes. I was always a big thinking without enough doing, so I ended up paying a lot of attention to my own thoughts. I discovered the world and sometime around my second or third year of undergrad I established a semi-regular practice of [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha-vipassana) meditation. I found great solace in my practice and around the same time started to learn about the [stoics](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736) thanks to an absolutely fantastic book my dad found at the Boulder Bookstore[^1]

Through meditation adn the stoics I found myself learning to be at ease with my thoughts. I learned about the passing nature of feelings and I learned how to avoid identifying myself with every emotion going through my head. Through the end of my undergraduate degree and the start of graduate school, I found myself in a lot life uncertainty as I tried to figure out what I wanted to do (and I had a couple of really dark moments), and I found great solace in the stoic idea of *amor fati* or love of fate. I had to swallow the pill that so much about life is just not under our control, and so much of "success" is just luck. For the first time, I felt peace in not worrying about absolutely everything and just letting things be. Saying like the serenity prayer became a mantra for me. It was all life-changing for the good. 

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

But now, I'm at a crossroads. Now that I've learned a little more about ambition and grown more confident in my abilities, pivoting into the real of rapid iteration into things I'm interested in, growing more confident at my abilities. On the one hand, I have grown confident enough to believe that I can achieve great things. As an engineer, I'd like to aim to solve great questions. Yet, this ambition requires standing at odds with the current state of the world. As George Bernard Shaw once said: 
> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
> 
And having the unreasonable-ness in oneself requires a degree of suffering that would ostensibly be gone if one were to blindly believe in *amor fati*. 

How does one manage this tension? I can only speak from personal perspective, but I think the key idea is to focus on productive unreasonableness. **Focus on changing what the laws of nature do not prohibit. And learn to be ok with the rest.** Concretely, and this is something I'm still learning to do myself, use discomfort to channel your energy into new iterations. For example, in the past I spent a lot of time pondering on the nature of hard problems, for example, how hard it is to come up with original and useful ideas during the PhD process. I think the key is to identify this angst, and do something about it, and then learn to be happy with whatever happens next. Be content with the idea that you tried to the absolute best of your abilities. Then learn to love the rest, because its mostly out of your control. 

Other ideas I should include
- Deep Work by Cal Newport
- Combine amor fati with hunger to make the world a better place.
- In a recent podcast I heard with Marc Andressen (might've been Lex or Huberman), he said something about how being an entrepreneur is like repeatedly getting punched in the face and eventually liking the taste of your own blood. Part of it, I think, is adopting the mindset of amor fati. Nothing is good or bad, it just is. Only you choose to interpret it as good or bad.


[^1] In the interest of completeness, because of my great appreciation to these people, I'd like to mention the two people that first introduced me to meditation and the stoics. I first heard about meditation through conversations with Ely Seiryu Rayek in my early teens.  ([here's a link to a talk he gave](https://zmm.org/podcast/ceaseless-becoming/)), a therapists I'd talk to with semi-regularly. I actually never got into the practice while I was working with him, but his calm and collected demeanor left a permanent impression in my mind I never forgot. And a lot of the way I deal with stress today is thanks to him. 
Onto the stoics, I first learned about them in a high school literature class taught by Juan Antonio Pacheco where we read and discussed Seneca's *Letters from a Stoic*. I distinctly remember how impressed I was by the timelessness of Seneca's ideas and I knew I had to read more. Alas, like I said, I was a thinker, not a doer, and it took me a couple more years to follow up on that interest.

I am a research assistant at UT Austin working on a PhD in robotics and AI.
I love [reading](bookshelf), [writing](writing), and [fitness](fitness).

I was born and raised in Mexico City where I spent most of time on books, video games, and friends. 
My father's family is from the small countryside town of Amecameca where I spent many happy childhood days visiting my grandparents, exploring the local [tianguis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufxVtso8C0), and hiking around the [Iztaccihuatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iztaccihuatl).
My time there was instrumental in shaping my love for nature and community. 

After highschool, I moved to Boulder, Colorado where I got my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from CU Boulder. 
There I worked on satellite navigation systems and software-defined radios at the [RF & SatNav Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/rf-satnav/) with [Dr. Dennis Akos](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/dennis-akos).

Boulder was also where I got into sports and I spent a **lot** of time riding my bike up and around the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
You can read more about my interest in sports and health [here](fitness). 
 
Currently, I am a research assistant and PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, where I work on decision-making algorithms for robots with [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil) at the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/). 
My work uses control theory, machine learning, and game theory.

My name is Fernando Palafox Escobedo. 
I was born and raised in Mexico City where I attended [The American School Foundation](https://www.asf.edu.mx/). 
There, I was fortunate to meet many great friends and teachers, many of whom I still keep in touch with today.
Most of my childhood and teenage years were spent on books, video games, and friends. 
I also had many happy days visiting my grandparents in the small countryside town of [Amecameca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amecameca).
The time I spent there was instrumental in shaping my love for nature and my understanding of the importance of community. 
After highschool, I moved to Boulder, Colorado where I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder. 
During my time there, I worked on satellite navigation technologies and software-defined radios at the [RF & SatNav Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/rf-satnav/) with [Dr. Dennis Akos](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/dennis-akos).
I also spent a lot of time riding my bike up and around the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. 
Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, where I work on artificial intelligence for robots with [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil) at the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/). 
You can read more about my research [here](research.md). 
I am also passionate about [reading](bookshelf), [writing](writing), and [fitness](health).

I'm interested in applying impedance control to a robotic manipulation task. 
This post is intended as a derivation of a basic impedance controller and a place to collect some of my thoughts. 

- Kinematics
- Jacobian Matrix
- Newton's Second Law
- Virtual Work Principle
- Relationship between torque, force, and displacement

I have more ideas than time. 
Here's a list of weekend hack ideas I'd like to work on. Feel free to steal them, and let me know if you make something cool!
- Pose estimation for tele-operation of robot arm. 
- Learn to use [TinyGrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) by training an MNIST classifier. 
- Finetune an LLM with my Google Keep notes.
- Follow Karpathy's tutorial on GPT's. [(Done 11/24)](research/ideas/hello_gpt.md)

I have more ideas than time. 
Here's a list of ideas I'd like to work on. Feel free to steal them, and let me know if you make something cool!

# Research
- Problem statement for a socially aware robot that learns from human demonstraitons. If I show the robot how to do something, I don't want it to just copy what I did, I want it to understand what my intentions where. In a manipulation setting, there could be an interesting game-theoretic application. 

# Weekend Hacks
- Pose estimation for tele-operation of robot arm. 
- Learn to use [TinyGrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) by training an MNIST classifier. 
- Finetune an LLM with my Google Keep notes.
- Follow Karpathy's tutorial on GPT's. [(Done 11/24)](research/ideas/hello_gpt.md)
- Pipeline for training humanoids using something like the Meta Ray Bans. Video -> Parametric model of a human -> data for humanoid -> train humanoid. Not an expert of this. But the hack would be to understand the challenges here. 
- Scraper for Joe Rogan's site to alert me when tickets for a new show are available.

August 2024

The plan was simple: meditate, lift, and code. 
This summer I left Austin for Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
I was offered an internship at Honda Research Institute working on self-driving cars, so I bought a car and drove to Michigan in late May. 
Me and a pile of books and that's what I did. 
Here's a bit of what I learned. 

Some numbers to get started
- Around 50-60 hours of meditation
- around 30 hours of Dharma talks/podcasts
- 36 runs
- 36 lifts
- 12 weeks 
- 10 books
- Many thousands of lines of code
- 60 days in the office. 

The intention was to go full monk mode. 
I'm normally a bit of a social butterfly and promptly check out running or cycling groups every time I move where new. 
However, this time I made an effort to spend more time by myself.

Release. 
First big realization is just how much built up tension I had to release. 
Physical and emotional release. 
I had some lingering neck tightness since February that slowly release over the course of the summer.
Meditation was incredibly good at helping me note and release it!
I found that the movement extremes were both really good with this: 
It's hard to describe, but meditating in the mornings and evenings I could feel myself releasing. 

Avoidance and strong emotions
As far as I can remember I tend to wakeup in a pretty terrible mood. 
Every time, particularly when I'm stresesd, I wake up and life seems terrible: like I'm doing the wrong thing, worrying about what people thing of me, etc.
Now, 
My usual habit is to drown out any emotions by promptly putting on a podcast, eating, or exercising. 
Obviously, this is a bandaid, so I determined to fix it this summer.
So, every morning I would sit in my bad mood and try to make friends with it.
Mind you, I was not perfect. 
In fact, many morning I would default to my habitual doomscrolling or distraction of choice. 
But, over time, i got better at welcoming the morning anxiety. 
Almost immediately I realized it wasn't as bad. 
It was just a thought, a feeling, and even though I could tell myself stories about it, I could choose not to follow with it.  
Some of the sits were incredibly intense: heat, sweat, elevated heartrate, even panic! 
I wrote a bit about this HERE. 

Relationship to anger and those that I don't like and/or make me feel uncomfortable. 
Negative self-talk, being more gentle to myself. 

Another big one was the avoidance of failure. 
I hate failing. 
But if you're not failing, you're not trying hard enough. 
And honestly, now that I'm trying carder things, failing is necessity. 
Turns out programming self-driving cars is not particularly simple.
So I focused on this.
I began to notice how much procrastination, even with relatively simple tasks, was because of the following simple idea: there's probably a better way of solving what I'm trying to do and I don't know about it yet. 

So much to write about here. 
For example, my phone and eating habits were a primary focus. 
So much of my time on the phone was just a direction. 

Facing fears.
Talking to beautiful girls. 
This one was particularly funny: I found it hilarious how my body would go into full fight-or-flight mode when going up to a pretty girl. 
Sweaty palms, heart pounding, and shaking hands (and legs!). 
All because I was talking to an attractive human being. 
Lol. 
This one was very fun. 
Turns out pretty girls are also humans. 
Lots to write about this, but it's also the first time in my life where I find myself single AND also really feeling myself. 
Felt almost like a second puberty.
Hard to describe it. 
Some inklings of wanting to settle down too and definitely optimizing for different values. 
Midwest has definitely made me appreciate this

Some wildly cathartic experiences. 
It felt like I was shedding so many layers. 
Highly spiritual 
The feeling of pure experience, becoming. 
Choosing what mask to put on 
Discovering who i want to be while letting go of who I think I should be.

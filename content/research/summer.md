August 2024

The plan was simple: meditate, lift, and code. 
This summer I left Austin for Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
I was offered an internship at Honda Research Institute working on self-driving cars, so I bought a car and drove to Michigan in late May.
All I brought was my laptop, a pile of books, and some clothes. 
Here's a bit of what I learned, and my thoughts on why every guy in their 20's should disapear for a bit and spend some time by themselves.

This is a collection of thoughts in no particular order, so just skip around to what sounds most interesting. 

### The Plan

My 2024 has been an incredible process of finding what I'm interested in when I'm not thinking of who I *should* be. 
This has involved taking a break from cycling (wow, I never thought I'd say this) and leaving most social media, certain social circles, and a relationship. 
I've found myself drawn towards running, lifting, coding, and meditation.
So, when I got the offer for the internship in April, I realized I had the perfect opportunity to take this process even further. 
I absolutely adore people, and when I'm in Austin I'm normally pretty booked with social commitments. 
I love my friends. 
However, this time the goal was simple: meditate, exercise, and code. 
Nothing else.
And that's exactly what I did. 

Some numbers to get started
- 3 months 
- ~60 hours of meditation
- 60 days in the office
- ~40 runs
- ~30 hours of meditation talks
- ~30 lifts
- 10 books
- Many thousands of lines of code

Here's what I learned

### Anger, Sadness, and Release
One of the first things I became aware of is how much built up tensions I had. 
Physically, I had some lingering neck tightness since February that I was finally able to release over the course of the summer by consistently noting how I held my body. 
I was suprised at how much tension I have in my face, particularly in my forehead and around the eyes. 
Consistenyl releasing this does wonders to your mood. 
Obviously sitting for meditation is incredibly useful for this, but it's not the only way, literally just taking a couple of seconds to note how you're holding your body does wonders to the body.  

Emotionally, I found a lot of sadness and anger.  
If I've come to a conclusion from all the reading and studying and ocnversation with smart people is that if there's anything to know about self-help books is that they're all about accepting emotions. 
So that's exactly what I set out to do.
I just accepted what I found, and it was mostly characterized by two emotions that kinda felt stuck: anger and sadness. 
Anger typically manifested itself when meditating both via meoitons: angry thoughts directed towards others, but mostly towards myself. 
"Be better!" "Work harder!" "How are you so dumb!" "What you just did was so cringe!" "Feeling like this is only slowing you down, suck it up, buttercup!"
Much of this summer was learning how to be more gentle, both with myself and with others, letting the anger flow, noting when pride made me hold on to it, and then just letting it go.
Sadness 
A big lesson was that it's possible to forgive and love pretty much everybody in a way that respects your boundaries.  
I found that the movement extremes were both really good with this: 
It's hard to describe, but meditating in the mornings and evenings I could feel myself releasing. 

# Avoidance and strong emotions
As far as I can remember I tend to wakeup in a pretty terrible mood. 
Every time, particularly when I'm stresesd, I wake up and life seems terrible: like I'm doing the wrong thing, worrying about what people thing of me, etc.
Now, 
My usual habit is to drown out any emotions by promptly putting on a podcast, eating, or exercising. 
Obviously, this is a bandaid, so I determined to fix it this summer.
So, every morning I would sit in my bad mood and try to make friends with it.
Mind you, I was not perfect. 
In fact, many morning I would default to my habitual doomscrolling or distraction of choice. 
But, over time, i got better at welcoming the morning anxiety. 
Almost immediately I realized it wasn't as bad. 
It was just a thought, a feeling, and even though I could tell myself stories about it, I could choose not to follow with it.  
Some of the sits were incredibly intense: heat, sweat, elevated heartrate, even panic! 
I wrote a bit about this HERE. 

## Understanding

# Anger
Relationship to anger and those that I don't like and/or make me feel uncomfortable. 
Negative self-talk, being more gentle to myself. 

# Failure
Another big one was the avoidance of failure. 
I hate failing. 
But if you're not failing, you're not trying hard enough. 
And honestly, now that I'm trying carder things, failing is necessity. 
Turns out programming self-driving cars is not particularly simple.
So I focused on this.
I began to notice how much procrastination, even with relatively simple tasks, was because of the following simple idea: there's probably a better way of solving what I'm trying to do and I don't know about it yet. 

So much to write about here. 
For example, my phone and eating habits were a primary focus. 
So much of my time on the phone was just a direction. 

# Feminine beauty
Talking to beautiful girls. 
This one was particularly funny: I found it hilarious how my body would go into full fight-or-flight mode when going up to a pretty girl. 
Sweaty palms, heart pounding, and shaking hands (and legs!). 
All because I was talking to an attractive human being. 
Lol. 
This one was very fun. 
Turns out pretty girls are also humans. 
Lots to write about this, but it's also the first time in my life where I find myself single AND also really feeling myself. 
Felt almost like a second puberty.
Hard to describe it. 
Some inklings of wanting to settle down too and definitely optimizing for different values. 
Midwest has definitely made me appreciate this

Some wildly cathartic experiences. 
It felt like I was shedding so many layers. 
Highly spiritual 
The feeling of pure experience, becoming. 
Choosing what mask to put on 
Discovering who i want to be while letting go of who I think I should be.

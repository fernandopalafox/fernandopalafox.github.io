[In this paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=q0dyHx4AAAAJ&citation_for_view=q0dyHx4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) we present a set of [software-defined radios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) (SDRs) for a variety of [global navigation satellite systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo.
Much of this work builds on the SDRs described in "[A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver: A Single-Frequency Approach](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~marsy/resources/gnss/A%20Software-Defined%20GPS%20and%20Galileo%20Receiver.pdf)" co-authored by my advisor [Dr. Dennis Akos](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/dennis-akos).

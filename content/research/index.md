I am a PhD student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at UT Austin. I am interested in **artificial intelligence for multi-agent interactions**. Concretely, I design control strategies for multi-agent interactions so that robots can safely, and smoothly, interact with other robots or humans. My work leverages game theory [(gt)](tags/gt), control theory [(ct)](tags/ct), and machine learning [(ml)](tags/ml). Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy)'s insanely productive weekend hacks I try to regularly work on weekend hacks [(wh)](tags/wh) where I try to learn/build something new.

I am currently part of the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) and I am advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil).
In the past I've also worked on software-defined radios for satellite navigation systems and low-cost, local positioning systems. You can read more about me [here](about).

I work on decision-making algorithms.  
Currently I'm PhD student at the [CLeAR Lab](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil). 
Find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q0dyHx4AAAAJ&hl=en), [GitHub](https://github.com/fernandopalafox), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-palafox/).

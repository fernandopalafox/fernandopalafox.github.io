I am a PhD student at the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil). 
**My mission is to build low-cost, socially aware, consumer robots to relieve humans of dangerous, boring, or physically demanding tasks such as driving, flying, household tasks, and/or manual labor.** 
I'd like to see a world where all humans can focus on what machines still canâ€™t do: creativity, knowledge creation, and living meaningful lives. 

**I focus on socially-aware robotics** because deployment beyond an academic setting will inevitably lead to interactions with other agents (i.e., humans, other robots, or animals). 
This means that safe and useful interactions will require **robots that can reason about the effect its actions have on other rational agents**. 
To that end, my research focuses on developing decision-making algorithms that enable robots to make real-time decisions in uncertain, multi-agent environments. 

A recent example of my research is my work on game-theoretic imitation learning, where a robot imitates behavior by observing a multi-agent interaction and learning what other agents want (objectives) and how they get it (constraints). Structuring the learning problem with a game-theoretic representation allows the robot to efficiently learn behavior that better generalizes. A concrete application of this can be found in my most recent publication [*Learning Hyperplanes for Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance in Space*](research/hyperplanes) which focuses on autonomous spacecraft that use expert demonstrations to learn how to optimally avoid collisions in close-proximity, multi-agent operations e.g., a collaborative space construction.

My work leverages **game theory** [(gt)](tags/gt), **control theory** [(ct)](tags/ct), and **machine learning** [(ml)](tags/ml). I sometimes work on weekend hacks [(wh)](tags/wh) to learn something new.
In the past I've also worked on software-defined radios for satellite navigation systems and low-cost, local positioning systems. You can read more about me [here](about).

# Current projects
Here's a list of projects I'm currently working on (please reach out if any of these sound interesting):
- Friction modelling of a robotic manipulator commanded via an impedance controller in a contact-rich manipulation task.
- Topologically-grounded, multi-agent trajectory generation for autonomous driving. Braid groups are fun!
- Uncertainty reduction in adversarial general-sum games with uncertainty about opponent's costs.

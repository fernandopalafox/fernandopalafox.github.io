I'm a PhD student at the [CLeAR Lab](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) at UT Austin and I work on decision-making algorithms for complex dynamical systems (like robots).
My research interests include game theory, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and control theory.
I'm advised by Dr. David Fridovich-Keil.

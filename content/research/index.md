I am a PhD student at the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) and I am advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil). 
My mission is to build low-cost socially aware robots to relieve humans of dangerous, boring, or physically demanding tasks, such as driving, flying, household tasks, and/or manual labor. 
I'd like to see a world where all humans can focus on what machines still canâ€™t do: creativity, knowledge creation, and living meaningful lives. 
I focus on socially-aware robotics because deployment beyond an academic setting will inevitably lead to interactions with other agents (i.e., humans, other robots, or animals). 
This means that safe, effective, and efficient interactions will require the robot to reason about the effect its actions will have on other agents. 
To that end, I develop decision-making algorithms that enable robots to make real-time decisions in uncertain, multi-agent environments.

My work leverages game theory [(gt)](tags/gt), control theory [(ct)](tags/ct), and machine learning [(ml)](tags/ml). I sometimes work on weekend hacks [(wh)](tags/wh) to learn something new.
In the past I've also worked on software-defined radios for satellite navigation systems and low-cost, local positioning systems. You can read more about me [here](about).

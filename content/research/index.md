I am a PhD student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at UT Austin. I am interested in **artificial intelligence for multi-agent interactions**. Concretely, I design control strategies for multi-agent interactions so that robots can safely, and smoothly, interact with other robots or humans. My work leverages dynamic game theory, optimal control, and machine learning. I am part of the [CLeAR Laboratory](https://clearoboticslab.github.io/) and I am advised by [Dr. David Fridovich-Keil](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/fridovich-keil).
 
In the past I've also worked on software-defined radios for satellite navigation systems and low-cost, local positioning systems.

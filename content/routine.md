# Exercise 

- Monday: Upper body lift (1hr). 
- Tuesday: Run with intervals. Intervals change depending on what I'm training for. 1hr. Mobility at night. A mix of my own routine and [David Thurin's free ebooks](https://stayflexy.co/collections/mobility-flexibility-guides).
- Wednesday: Lift. Sometimes a bike ride in the afternoon. 
- Thursday: Easy run. 45-60'. [Stability](#stability-routine) exercises. Inspired by [Ben Patrick's](https://www.youtube.com/c/thekneesovertoesguy) approach to strength/mobility.
- Friday: Lift.
- Saturday: Bike ride. 3-5hrs, depends on what I train for.
- Sunday: Long run. >1hr, depends on what I'm training for.

Current focus is on whole body strength and shorter run races (I've got a couple 5k's on the calendar).
Currently following [Old School Iron](https://athleanx.com/old-school-iron) and endurance training from [Brad Seng](https://www.d3multisport.com/our-coaches/brad-seng).
Since I don't get paid to do this, I typically stop any exercise the moment I feel even the slightest hint of an injury. 
This can be frustrating, but this approach has kept me injury free for a long time now.

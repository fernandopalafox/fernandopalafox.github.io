# Exercise 

- Monday: shoulder, arms, mobility, 10' core. 1hr
- Tuesday: Run with intervals. Intervals change depending on what I'm training for. 1hr
- Wednesday: Bike ride and stability. 1-2hrs
- Thursday: Easy run. 45-60'
- Friday: chest, back, posterior chain, 10' core. 1hr
- Saturday: Bike ride. 3-5hrs, depends on what I'm training for. 
- Sunday: Long run. >1hr, depends on what I'm training for.

Current focus is on getting a bit more upper body strength and slowly building up my running. 
In the near future, I'd like to focus on checking off all the [ATG strength and mobility standards](https://a1athlete.com/atg-standards/). 
Lifting routine is mostly from [ATG](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/)'s Muscle program and endurance training from [Brad Seng](https://www.d3multisport.com/our-coaches/brad-seng).
